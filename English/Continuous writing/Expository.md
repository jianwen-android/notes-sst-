# Modes of reasoning (Explanation)

## Cause and effect

- when action A, action B

## Deductive reasoning

- if A is true, and since B is a subset of A, it follows that B must be true

## Comparison and contrast

- What is the difference between A and B, therefore why is A better than B and why your point is true

## Counter argument and rebuttals

- introduce and problematise the counter-argument
	- "Some may argue that…"
	- "An alternative viewpoint that may have been mentioned is that"
	- make sure you are showing that this is not your points
- introduce your rebuttal using contrast connectors
	- "But"
	- "However"
	- "Nevertheless"

### You are wrong

- completely disprove the counter-argument

### Even if you are right

- yea you may be right
- but my point is applies to more people/better/more important etc.
