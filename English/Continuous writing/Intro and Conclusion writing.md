Have you ever thought about the modern inventions that we use on a daily basis? In the last century, people have engineered various contraptions to improve the different aspects of our lives. From washing machines to Light Emitting Diode (LED) lighting to online food delivery platforms, these all intend to convenience or enrich our lives in some way. However, some are not as essential as others - washing machine is definitely eases the work for housewives, it is not as essential as light is to a family in the dark. On the other hand, online food delivery platforms may be essential to families with limited physical mobility, but can be seen as a mere convenience for others. In this essay, I will state and explain which modern inventions from the last century are critical to a family in their daily life, and which are simply conveniences that they could do without.


In conclusion, while some inventions are now essential to a families way of life, others are just conveniences that they can live without. Regardless, they all aim to improve our lives in some way subtle or not. From the often overlooked source of illumination, to the admittedly not as important but still convenient automatic washer, to the situationally critical food delivery, providing us with one of the three basic human needs. Perhaps years from now, the average household will have different gadgets - with some new innovations being made, while others made obsolete. The gadgets that we take for granted everyday may be replaced by more advanced ones, as new technology pushes us towards the horizon. On the other hand, changes in culture, social norms and practices may see the return, or even a rebirth, of inventions once seen as irrelevant or outdated. We may not give so much as a second thought when going about our daily lives, but when we stop to think about it, it truly is amazing how modern inventions have changed our lives.
