> [!Note] Practice done in class
> (D)Though many years have passed, the wrinkles and spots have never worn down the bright and uplifting smile on my motherâ€™s face. As far back as my mind can take me, she has always been the one to provide support, from holding my hands as I took my first steps, to preparing invigorating snacks as I rigorously crammed for an exam the next day.
> (A)When others are in need, whether it be going through tough times, or needing someone to talk to, she is always ready to lend a hand, or a listening ear. Her positivity is like the shining sun in the cold, empty space, providing warmth and hope everywhere she goes. Like a wildfire it spreads to our family and the people around her, encouraging them to act the same - to be gracious to others in need and to uphold a optimistic view at every turn of life
