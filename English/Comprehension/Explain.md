# Explain {quote}â€¦

1. Find evidence from the text proofing the quote
2. Summarise the point of the evidence, which hopefully further explains the quote
- e.g. 2016 O Level Q16: "Explain what the writer means by describing the trunk as 'the elephant's most distinctive feature'"
	- Find evidence from the text talking about the features of the trunk
	- Infer -> the trunk acts as an additional limb
	- Ans: "When compared to other animals, only the elephant has a trunk that acts as an additional limb"
