# Unauthorised access

- occurs when data owned by someone is used by someone else without permission
- could lead to data loss or other not nice consequences

Unauthorised access can occur due to one or more of the following reasons:

1. Poor authentication
2. Poor access control or authorisation
3. Poor understanding of privacy policies

## Authentication

- process of verifying the identitiy of a user
- requires them to prove their identity by providing evidence from one or more of the following categories

1. Something the user knows, such as a password
2. Something the user owns, such as a mobile phone
3. Something unique that is measured from a physical part of the user, such as a thumbprint

Each category of evidence that is used for authentication is called an authentication factor.

Prevents identity theft

### Passwords

- Only known to the user
- Usually entered with a user name that identifies who the user is claiming to be
- Can be a poor form of authentication

#### Bad practices

- Avoid birthdates
- Avoid surnames
- Avoid easily guessable passwords

- Avoid re-using passwords
- Avoid leaving them unchanged

#### Solutions

1. Use a mixture of lower-case letters, upper-case letters, numbers and symbols
2. Use unique passwords for each computer or online account
3. Update at least once every 90 days

### Security tokens (2 factor authentication)

- Usually used when more than one authentication factor is needed
 - Generates an OTP for 2 factor authentication
 - (Security token itself) Alternative to mobile phones for the process of 2 factor authentication
 - Users should keep security tokens safe and secure
 - Report any missing tokens as soon as possible

#### Process

1. User authenticates with their password or personal identifiication number (PIN)
2. User enters in one-time password (OTP) generated by security token or mobile phone

#### Pros

- Intruders have to guess both the user's password and one-time password

#### Cons

- OTPs sent wirelessly can be intercepted and used
- If the secret algorithm used to generate OTPs is poorly chosen or accidentally revealed, intruders may be able to generate OTPs without a security token

### Biometrics

- Measurement of human characteristics
	- Fingerprint
	- DNA
	- Face
	- Iris
	- Retina
- More secure as physical characteristics measured are typically unique to each user and cannot be easily replicated

## Access control or Authorisation

- Ability of a computer to control a user’s access to data and resources
- Idea is to only give user control after authentication

### File permissions

- Settings to control the ability of users to view or make changes to the contents of a file or folder
- can be used together with file permissions
- Verify that a website’s address starts with “https://” and a padlock icon appears next to its address on a web browser before sending confidential customer data such as credit card information.

#### Administrator

- Can override permissions for any file or folder

### Firewall

- Device or computer program that prevents unauthorised access to or from a private network
	- blocks traffic - Transmission of data over a network
- can block based on
	- applications
		- stop certain harmful programs from sending copies of themselves to other computers through the network
	- unauthorised senders and/or receivers
		- prevents intruders from gaining access to the computers within a network

### Encryption

- encoding data so that a secret key is required to read the data
	- secret key is like password
- used to protect data from unauthorised access by allowing only authorised users to have the secret key

## Understanding of Privacy policies

### Definitions

#### Privacy

- Ability to keep specific data or resources from being known by others

#### Privacy policy

- Rules and practices followed by an organisation regarding the collection, protection and use of personal or private data provided by user

### Social Networking Sites

- can pose privacy concerns as most users do not read or consider the repercussions of the privacy policies

- Read and fully understand the privacy policy of the social networking site.
- Set your sharing settings to “private” so that only people you know in real life can read your posts.
- Think twice before posting any personal photographs or information that you may feel uncomfortable sharing.
- Accept friend requests wisely. Make sure you know everyone in your friends list.
