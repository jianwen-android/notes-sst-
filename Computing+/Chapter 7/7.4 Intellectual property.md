- might not come with source code, but usually does

## Free and Open source

- software where users are given freedom to change, copy, study and share the software
- same usage as [[#Public domain]] like being able to copy, modify and distribute
- but still protected under copyright
	- copyright owners may use this protection to require that the software must always be distributed with source code, that attribution to the original authors must always be provided or that any modifications must use a similar licence if they are also distributed

### Creative Commons (CC)

- source code for freeware and shareware is usually kept secret and modifying the software is usually illegal
	- it may be legal to copy and distribute freeware and shareware

### Freeware

- software that is available to use at no cost
- some of these may include "lite" versions of the full software, allowing users to try a limited version of the software while promoting the full versions
