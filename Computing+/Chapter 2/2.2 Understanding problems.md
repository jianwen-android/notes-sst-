# Input (algorithms)

- Data used by an algorithm that can affect what is required for correct output

1. include only the important data that can affect what we require o the output and exclude any irrelevant details; and
2. state the range of valid or acceptable values for these inputs

# Output (algorithms)

- Results produced by an algorithm

1. Include all the important features that the output is required to have
2. Any details no mentioned are unimportant or irrelevant

> [!note] Solution
Algorithm that always gives correct outputs when provided with valid inputs
