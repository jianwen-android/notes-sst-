# Network Interface Controller (NIC)

 - enables the transfer of data between a device and a network
 - can connect to a network physically or wirelessly
- has a unique 6-bit MAC address, see [[8.4 Applications of number systems#Mac Addresses|Chapter 8 MAC Addresses]]
- for example, network PCIE in computers or WiFi chip in phones (built in)

# Network hub

- simplest way to connect multiple devices to the same network
	- acts a loudspeaker
	- it broadcasts the data to all its connected devices
	- does not identify specific devices
		- thus, it does not selectively forward/select data to its intended recipient sunlike switch
	- when a hub receives a packet 
		- transmitted to all devices connected to the hub
	- when a device responds
		- response is sent to all devices connected to the hub
- **cheapest option** as it does not store any information about the devices connected to it
- can cause bottlenecks in overall network efficiency as it transmits data to all connected devices regardless of the intended recipient

# Network switch

- constructs a single network by connecting multiple similar networks together
	- typically connects multiple [[11.2 Types of Computer Networks#Local Area Network LAN|LANs]], which use the same protocol, together to create a combined network that can cover a larger physical area
- a switch monitors the **MAC addressses** (permanent) of the devices connected to it
	- compared to a network hub, the switch will be able to decide whether it should forward or drop a packet that it receives #question what does that mean??
	- (self note) so this means that if a switch receives a packet from computer A and sees that the destination MAC address is for another computer B connected to it, the switch will forward that packet to only computer B

# Router

- device that forwards packets between separate networks
- the networks connected to a router could have potentially different protocols
	- this means that the router will have to keep the networks seperate;
	- but use the respective Internet protocols to forward packets between networks
	- both devices (sending and receiving the packet) will have to be identifiable using IP addresses
- a router monitors the **IP addresses** (dynamic) of the devices connected to it

# Modem (Modulator-Demodulator)

- in charge of converting incoming and outgoing signals 
	- from analogue to digital and digital to analogue respectively
- short ranged mediums such as Ethernet cables are not suitable as they are susceptible to transmission error with more cable length
	- ISP use transmission mediums such as telephone lines or fibre optics for long distance communications
	- these mediums are not suitable for transmitting digitals data (1s and 0s)
	- therefore, there is a need to convert them to analogue (called a suitable form in the textbook) sounds for transmission (**modulation**)
	- on the other hand, the signals are converted back into digital data again (**demodulation**)
