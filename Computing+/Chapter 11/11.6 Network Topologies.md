# Bus topology

- think electronics bus
	- common cable/backbone is known as the bus; bus is a medium that allows transmission of data
	- every device is connected to the bus (in parallel for electronics haahahahahahahaha)
	- allows all devices to communicate with other devices on the bus (server/printer/other computers etc.)
	- sender will transmit data along the bus and all the devices connected to the bus can detect that data is being transmitted
		- but only the intended recipient will accept and process the data
- if something happens on the network
	- computer: its fine
	- bus: you're dead

## Advantages

- easy and cheap to install
	- uses less cabling than other network designs
- scalable
	- new computers can be easily added
- can continue to operate even when one of the computers break down (hahahahahahahah)
- good for small networks

## Disadvantages

- a break along the bus may disable the entire network (hahahaha)
- capacity and length of the bus will limit the size of the network
- 1 bus is unsuitable for networks with many computers; 
	- performance slows down as the number of computers increases

# Ring topology

- its a ring.
- each device is is connected to 2 other adjacent devices
	- all data is passed around in the same direction of the ring
- the entire network will fail,
	- if a failure occurs in the cable or
	- if a computer breaks down

## Advantages

- can operate over larger distances and handle more data than bus topology
- central server to **manage the server** not needed as data packets transmitted through other computers will always reach its recipient

## Disadvantages

- if computer or cable in the network fails, the entire network may fail as the data cannot be passed on
- adding new computer into the network means that the whole network will have to be temporarily disrupted

# Star topology

- each computer is the leg of the star (not limited to 5)
	- in the middle of the star is a [[11.5 Network Hardware and Their Functions#Network hub|hub]] or a [[11.5 Network Hardware and Their Functions#Network switch|switch]]
	- computers will send data to the central network hardware^
	- and the hardware will forward the data to the intended destination

## Advantages

- The load on each section of cabling is reduced as each computer uses a separate cable from the rest
- If a fault occurs at a computer or cable, it is easy to isolate the fault and do a replacement without affecting the rest of the network

## Disadvantages

- uses more cabling than the other topologies; costs more
- if the central network hardware fails, the whole network fails

# Mesh topology

- same network, multiple routers
- routers connect to the devices on demand
