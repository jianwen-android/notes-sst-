# Geographical location

> [!INFO] Area network
> a network of connected computing devices

## Local Area Network (LAN)

- within a small geographical area
- yypically within the same building
- e.g. home, school or office

## Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

- spanning across two or more buildings
- within the same town and city

## Wide Area Network (WAN)

- covering a large-scale geographical area
- across multiple geographical locations

# Transmission mediums

## Wired network

- connection by a physical medium
- e.g. cables

- Ethernet is the most used wired network protocol

| Cable Type | Frequency | Max Speed | Max Cable Length |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | ---------------- |
| Cat5/5e    | 100Mhz    | 100Mbps   | 100m             |
| Cat 6      | 250Mhz    | 1Gbps     | 100m             |
| Cat 6a     | 500Mhz    | 10Gbps    | 100m             |
| Cat 7      | 600Mhz    | 10Gbps    | 100m             |
| Cat 8      | 2000Mhz   | 40Gbps    | 100m             |

> cables of high speed are not just used from provider to network, but also within networks

## Wireless network

- A wireless network is a network of devices in which signals are transmitted without the use of a physical medium. The transmission is in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves and microwaves. Users can be connected to a wireless network as long as they are within range of the network coverage.

The most common wireless network protocol is Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to transmit data.

# Organisation

## Client-server network

- 1 or more high capacity computers act as servers
- the remaining computers are clients
- high entry cost
	- specialised high performance servers needed
- **typically high bandwidth
	- **limited by the capability of the server**
- **high security**
	- **rights can be controlled centrally at the server**
- **storage is centralised**
	- **carried out only at server**
	- **usually managed by a network admin**

### Advantage

-   Centralised control of data and resources
-   Easy to schedule backups of all shared files at regular intervals
-   Security may be enhanced with the use of specialised software or operating system features that are designed for servers

### Disadvantage

-   Higher initial cost due to the need for a server
-   Administrative costs needed for the maintenance of server and clients

## Peer to Peer (P2P)

- all computers considered equal
	- load is distributed equally
	- each computer can act as a client and a server
	- communicating directly with other computers in the network
**- low cost network
	- basic computers can act as servers to share resources**
- bandwidth varies depending on how data needs to be transmitted
	- reduced if large requests have to be handled by 1 computer
	- increased if large requests are divded and handled by multiple computers simultaneously
- low security
	- handled by each computer, not by a central server
**- storage is decentralised 
	- can be carried out by individual users at each computer**

### Advantage

-   Cheaper to set up as there is no cost related to dedicated servers
-   Easy to set up as no specialised software or operating system features are needed

### Disadvantage

-   More effort is required to access and back up resources as they are stored locally within each computer instead of centrally in a server
-   Security is an issue as access rights are not administered by a central server
