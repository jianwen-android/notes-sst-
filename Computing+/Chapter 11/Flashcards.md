# Computer Network

## Advantages

Shared resources:::A network allows a group of computers to make use of ==shared resources== such as ==printers or files==

Shared Internet access:::Depending on the networkâ€™s configuration, every user who ==logs on== to the network may have ==access to the Internet==.

- Shared software: Software:
    - Can be stored on the central server of a network and deployed to other computers over a network
- Shared storage:
    - Data files can be stored on a central server for ease of access and backup purposes
- Communication:
    - Computers in the same network are often able to share instant messages and emails for communication

# Disadvantages

- Initial costs
	- installing a network could be costly due to the high setup and equipment costs
- Maintenance costs
	- There are also subsequent costs associated with administering and maintaining the network.
- Security risks
	- As files are shared through a network, there is the risk of virus or worm attacks spreading throughout the network even with just one infected computer.
- Risk of data loss
	- Data may become lost due to hardware failures or errors. Using a network means regular data backups are needed.
- Server outage
	- If the server fails, the network will not be able to function, thus affecting work processes.
