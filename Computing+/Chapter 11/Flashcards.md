# Computer Network

## Advantages

A network allows a group of computers to make use of ==shared resources== such as printers or files.
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

Depending on the networkâ€™s configuration, every user who logs on to the network may have ==access to the Internet==.
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

==Shared software== can be stored on the central server of a network and deployed to other computers over a network
<!--SR:!2022-08-02,1,218-->

==Data files== can be stored on a central server for ease of access and backup purposes
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

Computers in the same network are often able to ==share instant messages and emails for communication==.
<!--SR:!2022-08-02,1,218-->

## Disadvantages

Installing a network could be ==costly== due to the high setup and equipment costs
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

There are ==subsequent costs== associated with administering and maintaining the network.
<!--SR:!2022-08-03,2,238-->

As files are shared through a network, there is the risk of ==virus or worm attacks spreading throughout the network even with just one infected computer==.
<!--SR:!2022-08-02,1,210-->

Data may become lost due to ==hardware failures or errors==. Using a network means regular data backups are needed.
<!--SR:!2022-08-02,1,218-->

If the server fails, the network will not be able to function, thus ==affecting work processes==.
<!--SR:!2022-08-03,2,238-->


# Types of Computer Networks

An area network is a ==network of connected computing devices==
<!--SR:!2022-08-02,1,218-->

## Geographical Size

A ==Local Area Network (LAN)== is a network within a small geographical area, typically within the same building. For example in a home, school or office
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

A ==Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)== is a network spanning across two or more buildings, but usually within the same town and city
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

A ==Wide Area Network (WAN)== is a network covering a large-scale geographical area, typically spanning across multiple geographical locations
<!--SR:!2022-08-04,3,258-->

## Transmission mediums

What is a wired network, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as its most used network protocol for LANs and MANs
?
- A wired network is a network of devices connected by a physical medium, such as cables
- Advantages
	- Data transfer is typically faster
	- data transfer is more secure in a wired network
- Disadvantages
	- The number of devices/the distance between devices increase, the cost of setting up the network increases as well.
- Ethernet is the most used wired network protocol for LANs and MANs
<!--SR:!2022-08-03,2,238-->

What is a wireless network, its advantages and disadvantages, as well as its most used network protocol
?
- A wireless network is a network of devices in which signals in the form of electromagnetic waves, such as radio waves and microwaves, which are transmitted without the use of a physical medium. 
	- becoming increasingly popular in homes and businesses
- Advantages
	- Users can be connected to a wireless network as long as they are within range of the network coverage.
	- lower in cost
	- easy to configure and manage
- The most common wireless network protocol is Wi-Fi, which uses radio waves to transmit data.

## Organisation

### Client-server network

What is a client-server network and its characteristics
?
- 1 or more high capacity computers act as servers
- the remaining computers are clients
- high entry cost
	- specialised high performance servers needed
- **typically high bandwidth
	- **limited by the capability of the server**
- **high security**
	- **rights can be controlled centrally at the server**
- **storage is centralised**
	- **carried out only at server**
	- **usually managed by a network admin**


What are the advantages and disadvantages of a client-server network
?
- Advantages
	- Centralised control of data and resources
	- Easy to schedule backups of all shared files at regular intervals
	- Security may be enhanced with the use of specialised software or operating system features that are designed for servers
- Disadavantages
	- Higher initial cost due to the need for a server
	- Administrative costs needed for the maintenance of server and clients

### Peer to Peer (P2P)
What is a peer to peer network and its characteristics
?
- all computers considered equal
	- load is distributed equally
	- each computer can act as a client and a server
	- communicating directly with other computers in the network
**- low cost network
	- basic computers can act as servers to share resources**
- bandwidth varies depending on how data needs to be transmitted
	- reduced if large requests have to be handled by 1 computer
	- increased if large requests are divded and handled by multiple computers simultaneously
- low security
	- handled by each computer, not by a central server
- **storage is decentralised 
	- **can be carried out by individual users at each computer**

What are the advantages and disavantages of a peer to peer network
?
- Advantages
	- Cheaper to set up as there is no cost related to dedicated servers
	- Easy to set up as no specialised software or operating system features are needed
- Disadvantages
	- More effort is required to access and back up resources as they are stored locally within each computer instead of centrally in a server
	- Security is an issue as access rights are not administered by a central server

# Factors affecting choice of transmission mediums

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (cost)
?
Initially cheaper but becomes more expensive as network grows in size due to the cost of cables
Initially expensive due to the cost of wireless networking equipment but becomes more cost-effective as network grows in size

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (speed of transmission and bandwidth)
?
Faster and higher bandwidth as cables provide dedicated connection
Generally slower and lower bandwidth due to possible interference from radio waves or microwaves; varies according to user location in relation to network

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (reliability)
?
More reliable as data transmission is unaffected by interference
Less reliable due to potential interference from radio waves and microwaves or blockage from physical obstructions

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (security)
?
More secure as the network is less susceptible to interception and hacking
Less secure due to possible intrusion by hackers

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (mobility of users)
?
Lower as network connections are fixed at specific spots and users cannot move to other locations
Higher as users can move about freely within the range of the wireless network                                                                             


What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (scalability)
?
More cumbersome to add new devices to the network as physical constraints and the running of cables need to be considered
Easier to add new devices to the network as the router can be easily configured        

What are the considerations behind wired and wireless transmission mediums (physical organisation)
?
Tends to look more disorganised due to cables running across floors
More organised without cables
