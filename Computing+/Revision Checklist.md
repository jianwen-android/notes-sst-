# Note

1. Explaining of problem solving techniques not required (?)
2. Half of Chapter 4 is focused on Python programming (tested but trivial in theory paper)
3. Explaning of symbols or psuedocode syntax is not required
	1. Note that they can still ask you what a flowchart or psuedocode is supposed to do
4. Chapter 9 is solely on logic gates (no explaining so everything has already been covered by Electronics)
