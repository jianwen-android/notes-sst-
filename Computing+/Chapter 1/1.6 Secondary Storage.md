# Secondary storage

- where large amounts of data are stored, such as in a hard disk or hard drive
	- typically use the word “storage” for this kind of storage space instead of the word “memory”
	- Different storage media are used for secondary storage

# Types of storage media

## Magnetic

- data stored on magnetic material
	- can be read and written with a magnetic "head"
- hard disk

### Advantages

- large storage capacities of up to terabytes of data

### Disadvantages

- easily damaged and will eventually break over time
- much slower than solid-state storage media

## Optical

- data stored as very small pits or indentations that can be read or written by a laser
- dvd

### Advantages

- large storage capacity of up to gigabytes of data

### Disadvantages

- some formats can only have data written once
- lower max storage capacity than magnetic storage media
- vulnerable to scratches and fingerprints

## Solid-state

- data stored in electronic circuits
	- called flash memory
	- no moving parts

### Advantages

- faster than the previous 2
- not vulnerable to drops, mechanical shocks, scratches or optical storage media

### Disadvantages

- more expensive
