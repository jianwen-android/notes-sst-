- used to store data in bits, grouped into bytes
- position of each byte is represented by a number called the address

# Types of Memory

## Processor Registers

- physically located inside the processor
- extremely fast but small data storage spaces
	- used directly by the ALU and control unit
	- number and size of processor registers cannot be changed without changing the processor

## Random Access Memory (Main Memory)

- where data and instructions are stored temporarily so that they can be quickly accessed by the processor when needed
	- e.g. when an application is started, its instructions may be loaded into RAM
	- Data stored on RAM can be easily changed and is also volatile, which means that it is lost once the power supply to the computer is interrupted.

## Read-only Memory (ROM)

- where data and instructions that rarely need to change or would be needed for a computer to start up are stored
- data stored on ROM cannot be easily changed and remains there regardless of whether the power supply is switched on or off
	- makes it ideal for storing instructions that are needed before data can be loaded into RAM
