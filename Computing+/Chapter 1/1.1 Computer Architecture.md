# Units of Data

- smallest unit: bit
	- binary digit; has a value of 0 or 1
- 8 * bit: byte

| Name of unit | Symbol | Size in bytes              |
| ------------ | ------ | -------------------------- |

# Inside the computer

## Processor

- processes data and follows instructions; consists of an arithmetic logic unit and a control unit

## Memory

- stores data, instructions and the results of processing for immediate use

## Secondary storage

- stores large amount of data that will not be lost when power supply is interrupted

## Data bus

- transports data between memory and processor; bi-directional

## Address bus

- transport required memory location from processor to memory; uni-directional

## Input

- Data or instructions that the computer receives for processing

## Output

- intermediate or final results produced by the computer; usually in the form of processed data
