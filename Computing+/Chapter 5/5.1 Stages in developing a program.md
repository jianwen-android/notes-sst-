# Gather requirements

- find why program is needed
	- is it necessary?
	- e.g. conduct interviews
- find required inputs and outputs

# Plan solutions

- consider resources available
- plan and lay out a solution
- use decomposition, pattern recognition and generalisation (see [[2.3 Problem solving techniques]])

# Write code

- write code that performs the algorithm as planned, as efficiently as possible

# Test and refine code

 Also look at [[Chapter 6]]

- further refine code
- possible reasons
	- may have made mistakes in [[#Write code]]
	- may have not performed [[#Plan solutions]]
	- may have been incomplete in [[#Gather requirements]]

## Test case

A set of inputs and the corresponding set of expected outputs for a particular program used to verify whether the program works as intended

## Testing

Process by which defects in a program can be detected

# Deploy code

- "rolled out" and used by its intended audience
- e.g. transitioning old program to new one, teaching users how to use program
- can further test and refine code from feedback from the users right
