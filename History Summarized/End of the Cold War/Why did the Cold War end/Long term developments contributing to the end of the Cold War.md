# American economic and military superiority

In the 1970s, due to economic downturns, American president Ronald Reagan began a process of economic liberation - encouraging individual enterprise instead of having people rely on the government for good and services, while cutting national budgets and selling off national assets such as phone companies, oil companies and airlines. Other Western European countries also followed Reagan and this resulted in a significant economic growth against the Soviet Union. This is shown by how in 1970, the Soviet Union had 433 billion American dollars in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and the USA had 1025, while in 1990, the Soviet Union still only had 776 billion while the USA had grown to over 5755 billion. This greatly impacted the Cold War as Reagan simultaneously renewed the arms race, pressuring the economically weaker USSR to keep up with military expenditure and production, causing the USSR to eventually collapse economically.
