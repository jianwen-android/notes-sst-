# Reduction of tensions due to détente

Under the administration of Richard Nixon, America implemented a set of policies that focused on increasing trade and cooperation with the Soviet Union, acknowledging the USSR as a sovereign state. During the period of détente, both countries sought to reduce tension and avoid conflict that might escalate to nuclear war.  Brezhnev, the leader of the USSR at the time, also entered negotiations and signed treaties with the US, limiting the number of nuclear arms, as well as fostering economic cooperation and improving political relations between the two. For example, both sides held the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT I) in 1972 to attempt to limit and reduce the number of nuclear weapons that they possessed. Therefore, with increasing cooperation and reduced tension from the lessening of nuclear weapons against one another, there was a reduction of tensions during the period of détente
