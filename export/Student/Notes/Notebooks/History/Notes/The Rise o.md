# Favourable circumstances

[[Weimar republic]] #Also look at

## Death of Stresemann

- After the death of Stresemann, there were no other capable leaders to handle Germany's political and economic problems
- Germans lost faith in democracy as the leaders were unable to solve their problems
- Preference for authoritarian leadership rose again

## The Great Depression of 1929

- American economy collapsed with Wall Street Crash of 24 October '29
- USA withdrew loans to Germany, leading to collapse of economy again, & 6 million unemployed by 1933
- Communists & Nazis promised solutions to these solutions;
- Data shows that *extremist parties* gained support at the expense of moderate parties

## The fear of Communism

- Rich industrialists, farmers and bankers supported the Nazis as they feared that the Communists might win the elections & suffer similarly to those in USSR
- They thought that the Nazis would offer a strong solution to Germany's woes and thus good for the economy
- They knew Hitler was anti-communist and would avert a revolution similar to that of USSR

## Failure of Opposition Parties to Unite

- The Nazis never ever won a majority (51%) in the Reichstag
- However the Communist Party, Centre Party & the Social Democrats refused to unite due to political differences
- Leading politicians convinced a reluctant President Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as Chancellor, convinced they could manipulate Hitler & use his popularity to rule Germany
- Hindenburg had no choice but to appoint Hitler as Chancellor

- 1924 - won 32 out of 647 seats

## Skilfulness in making deals with politicians

- Willing to wait for the right opportunity to take power gradually
    - 1st year as Chancellor → noted in a coalition government
    - Subsequently → acted decisively to take complete control of the government (when he had enough support)

## Charisma & oratorical skills

- Powerful speaker and communicator
- Key characteristic/things he did:
    - Highly emotive: strong body language → prepared and practised his speeches
    - Addressed people's concerns by exploiting their fears
        - Offered simple solutions to big problems

## Exploited people's fears

- Knew the people's concerns
- Used 'November criminals', communists and the Jews as scapegoats for Germany's ills
