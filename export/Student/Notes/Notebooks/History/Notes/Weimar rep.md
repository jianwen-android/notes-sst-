❔ *Was the Weimar Republic doomed to fail*

</aside>

- Germany was in ruins
- 9 Nov 1918: Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated
- 6 Feb 1919: National Assembly met in Weimar
    - 1st President: Friedrich Ebert
    - 1st Chancellor: Philipp Scheidemann

# The Weimar Constitution

- Adapted on 11 Aug 1919
- Spelt out the "basic rights and obligations" of government officials and the citizens they served
    - E.g. equality before the law, freedom of religion, privacy

## Proportional Representation

- Germans voted for a party, rather than a candidate, to fill the Reichstag (the German legislature)
- The elections determined the percentage of seats each party received in the Reichstag, but the parties themselves selected the individuals who filled each allotted seat
- For example, if a party received 36% of the vote, they would get 36% of the seats in the Reichstag
- Was a good system if not for the fact that Germany was in the midst of post war crisis and had many problems plaguing it

### Advantage

- Prevents concentration of power in the hands of one ruler e.g. Kaiser
- Wide range of views representing the people's political orientation

### Negatives

- Too many views, difficult to get consensus
- Parties could not obtain 50.1% of votes & needed to form a coalition government
    - Parties combining their votes to form the government

# Problem?

## Weak support

"The November Criminals"

- Germans remembered the Weimar Republic for its role in signing the Treaty of Versailles
- Did not forgive the members of the government
- Desired leaders who would help Germany break the Treaty
- WR held responsible for the following economic problems:
    - Reparations for war damage had effectively bankrupted the German economy
    - Loss of Saar, Germany's industrial heartland and Alsace-Lorraine in the Treaty of Versailles
    - Fewer goods produced - people lost jobs
    - Soldiers returned home with no jobs

### Convenient to use the government as scapegoat

## Economic woes

- Bad state of economy made things worse
    - Raw materials were under foreign control, Saar and Alsace-Loraine (Centres of iron and steel production)
    - Production in mines and factories reduced
    - Led to massive unemployment
    - Shopkeepers and trades suffered as people had less to spend
    - Soldiers were jobless and ended up begging
    - Thus did not have enough money to pay for reparations
- 1923, France was angry and decided to invade the Ruhr, and area in western Germany - centre of the country's heavy industries (coal mines, iron and steel works)
- German workers went on strike, silently encouraged by the WR
    - Factories stopped producing goods
    - Price went up
    - Price increase went out of control; value of money fell
    - Govt. response: Print more money
    - Money became worthless - hyperinflation
    - People's savings wiped out
    - Standard of living dropped drastically
- Many Germans suffered and turned very bitter
    - Many blamed the government
    - Led to support for extreme parties from both the right and the left wing

## Disillusionment with Democracy

- Germany was formed in 1871 & had a monarchy with the Kaiser in charge
- Lacked a tradition of democracy; desired strong autocratic leaders who could deliver results
- Belief further reinforced when the government failed to solve various problems
- The President used Article 48 of the Constitution to rule by 'emergency'
- Chancellor (PM) often by-passed the Reichstag using the President's emergency powers

Frequent attempts to overthrow the Weimar Republic by the left & right wing political parties

**Spartacist Uprising 1919**

- Tried to overthrow the Weimar Government
- Ebert used army & right wing Freikorps to shoot the communists & end the rebellion. Lasted 8 days

**Kapp Putsch**

- Right wing group angry with the Weimar Republic for signing TOV. Tried to overthrow govt. by violent means
- Soldiers took over Berlin & declared new govt. under Wolfgang Kapp. Lasted 4 days

**Munich Putsch/ "Beer Hall" Putsch, 1923**

- Took place in a large beer hall in Munich
- 3000 Germans gathered there to listen to a speech by the state commissioner of Bavaria
- Hitler jumped on a chair and proclaimed, "The national revolution had broken out."
- The Nazis then held a demonstration march to the centre of Munich
- Clashed with the police
- Hitler escaped but was later arrested
- Sentenced to 5 years jail for treason
- Served 9 months in jail before he was released

# Stressman?

- 1924-1929 was the golden period of the Weimar Republic
- Economic & political recovery due to the leadership of Gustav Stresemann
- WR under Gustav Stresemann
    - First as Chancellor (Prime Minister), then as Foreign Minister for much of 1923-29
    - Wanted Germany to be prosperous again
    - Sought better relations with other countries
    - One of his first achievements - persuade the French to withdraw their troops from the Ruhr
    - Helped to get factories producing again
    - People could find more work
- France agreed provided Germany paid reparations
    - Stresemann agreed but tried to buy time for payment
    - Made a deal with US - Germany would not fall back behind its payments if given more time and loans to help economy recover
    - At the time, he resolved the currency problem
    - Withdrew all the old money (mark) and replaced it with a new currency (rentenmark) which had proper financial backing
    - Boost people's confidence in the new currency
- Stresemann's greatest interest was in foreign affairs
    - Aimed to make Germany the strongest country in Europe again
    - Plan was to get on better terms with other countries and convince them to trust Germany again
    - His hope was to recover some of the lands and rights that Germany had lost at the Treaty of Versailles

## Treaty of Locarno

- Signed with Germany's wartime enemies in 1925
- WR agreed not to try and recover any of its lost lands in western Germany
- Helped make Britain, France and Italy less suspicious

### Getting Germany into the League of Nations

- Kellogg-Briand pact (not by Stresemann and not under the treaty)
    
    Made a pact in which they promised that they will never use war to solve their problems
    
- League of Nations - again controlled by Germany's wartime enemies
- By joining them in Sep 1926, indicated that they were on better terms
- Bitter feelings aroused by war *subsided*

### Getting the USA to agree to an even better deal about reparation payments

- The Dawes Plan 1924 in which USA would invest 40 million pounds in Germany
- Followed by the **Young Plan***, made in **1929**
- In return for promising that it would continue to pay reparations, the amount that Germany had to pay was greatly reduced
- From 6,600 million pounds to 1,850 million pounds
- Spread over 59 annual payments
