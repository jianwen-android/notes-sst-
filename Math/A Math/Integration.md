# Rules

## Reverse power rule

Add 1 to the power of x, then divide it by the power

$$ \int_{a}^{b} x^2 \,dx \ = \frac{x^3}{3} + c $$

### Reverse chain rule

Add 1 to the power of the function, then divide it by its derivative multiplied by the power

$$ \int_{a}^{b} (2x + 5)^3 \,dx \ = \frac{(2x + 5)^4}{4\times2} + c = \frac{(2x + 5)^4}{8} + c
$$

# Applications
