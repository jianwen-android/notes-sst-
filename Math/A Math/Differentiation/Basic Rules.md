#  Power Rule

$$ \frac{d}{dx}x^n = nx^{n-1} $$

# Chain Rule

$$ \frac{d}{dx} (ax^b + c)^d = d \cdot (ax^b + c)^{d-1} \cdot a \cdot b \cdot x^{b-1} $$

# Product Rule

$$ \frac{d}{dx}f(x)g(x) = f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x) $$

# Quotient Rule

$$ \frac{d}{dx}\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2} $$
