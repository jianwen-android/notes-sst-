# Half-bridge rectifiers

![[Pasted image 20220509143252.png]]
- ideal diode assumes that there is no voltage drop across the diode
	- therefore, the positive output is the same as the input
- with simplified or practical model though, there is a voltage drop
	- assuming V_f = 0.7, then
	- when input voltage is < 0.7V, output = 0V
	- peak output voltage = peak input voltage - 0.7V

# Full-bridge rectifiers

- now we x2 half wave (technically x4), in order to convert the negative voltage part of AC input
- we can do this by "connecting" diodes in forward bias with the negative voltage, and kind of putting it in parallel to the other diodes

- note that the voltage drop from input to output should now be V_f * 2

# Rectifying circuit

WHAT ARE THE PARTS OF A RECTIFYING CIRCUIT YO

## 1.  Transformers

1.  Help to step up or down your AC voltage level

## 2.  Rectifying

1.  Full bridge rectifier
2.  Half bridge rectifier
3.  That other obscure one that no one uses anymore (centre tapped full/half wave rectifier)

## 3.  Filtering

![[6.5 Resistor-Capacitor (RC) Circuit#Rectifier Filtering]]

## 4.  Regulator

 1. If voltage across the capacitor is high enough, the zener diode will hold it at Vz
 2. Remember your current limiting resistor for the diode yo
	 - should be connected in parallel to capacitor
	 - zener diode should be connected in series with resistor, in parallel with the load
