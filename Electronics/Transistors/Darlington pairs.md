# Connection

# DC Current Gain

$$ \beta_{DC} \: \text{of} \: Q_1 \: \times \beta_{DC} \: \text{of} \: Q_2 $$

# Advantages and Disadvantages

- switching speed will be slower as base current needs to first switch on $Q_1$, which will then switch on $Q_2$
- There are 2 PN junctions between the base of $Q_1$ and the emitter of $Q_2$
	- therefore, the base activation voltage required will be double that of a single BJT
- bigger voltage drop across the collector and emitter ($V_{CE}$) in the saturation region
	- lower voltage across the load
