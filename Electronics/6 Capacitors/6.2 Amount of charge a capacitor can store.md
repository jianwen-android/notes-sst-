# Capacitance

- determines the amount of charge it can store at a particularw voltage level
	- bigger capacitance = more charge it can store

- bigger area in metal plates = bigger capacitance
- longer distance between metal plates = smaller capacitance
- lower permittivity (depends on material used for dielectric) = bigger capacitance

## Formula

$$ C = \frac{Q}{V} $$
**or**
$$ Q = CV $$

- where C is capacitance (farads)
- Q is charge (coulombs)
- V is voltage (voltage duh)
