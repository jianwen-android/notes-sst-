# Polarised

- bigger capacitance (micro to milli)
- fixed positive and negative terminals
- can range from big to really big

## Examples

- aluminium capacitors

# Non-polarised

- smaller capacitance (usually in pico)
- no fixed polarity
- can range from being small to small

## Examples

- mica capacitors
- ceramic capacitors

# Reading

## Polarised

- usually written on the capacitor directly

## Non-polarised

- if there are 2 digits:
	- the number is your capacitance * 10^6
	- 47 is 47 pF
- if there are 3 digits
	- first 2 numbers * 10^(third digit)
	- 472 is 47 * 100 pF = 4700pF

# Maximum working voltage

- voltage applied across a capacitor should not exceed this voltage;
- otherwise, capacitor will be damaged (go boom)
- usually written on the packaging together with the capacitance
	- not sure about ceramic (non-polarised) capacitors
