# Structure

1. metal plate
2. dielectric (insulating material)
3. metal plate

# Charging

- connect to battery
	- connect negative to negative
	- positive to positive
	- electrons flow from negative terminal to negative

# Discharging (not talking about safety)

- connect to load (light bulb or led wtv)
	- connect negative to positive
	- connect positive to negative
	- cause electrons flow in reverse direction from when you charged it
	- so electrons flow from negative terminal like in batteries
- use it like a battery damn it

# Safety precautions

- without a discharge path, capacitors can hold on to electric charges for a long time
- dangerous to anyone working on a circuit with it;
	- especially if capacitor is charged to a high voltage
- therefore, connect a resistor between the 2 metal plates (2 leads) to discharge safely
- don't just short the two plates cause it will create a large current spike, damaging the capacitor
