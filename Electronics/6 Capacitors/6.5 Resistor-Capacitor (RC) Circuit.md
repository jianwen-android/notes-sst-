# Charging & Discharging (RC Circuits)

- when adding a resistor in series with a capacitor, we can limit the current flow
- this allows us to control how long or short the charging & discharging time of the capacitor will be

## Time constant

$$ t = RC $$
- t = time constant (seconds)
- R = effective resistance in series with capacitor (Î©)
- C = capacitance of capacitor (F)

### Charging

- 1t = 66.6% of applied voltage
- 5t = 97.3% of applied voltage (effectively charged)

```desmos-graph
left=-1; right=7;
top=11; bottom=-1;
---
y = -1.28837e^{-1.09006x + 1.94815} + 9.03882|0<=x
(0,0)|open|label:0%
(1,6)|open|label:66.6%
(5,9)|open|label:97.3%
```

### Discharging

- 1t = 33.3% of applied voltage
- 5t = 0.7% of applied voltage (effectively discharged)

```desmos-graph
left=-1; right=7;
top=11; bottom=-1;
---
y = 0.620221e^{-1.39425x+2.70863} + 0.691264|0<=x
(0,10)|open|label:100%
(1,3)|open|label:33.3%
(5,0.7)|open|label:0.7%
```

# Application

- usually to keep track of time and create time delays

## Rectifier (Filtering)

1. Capacitor can help to lessen the range of the output voltage created by rectifier
2. Charge capacitor when AC signal is at peak; Discharge when AC signal is trough
3. Issa capacitor of correct capacitance
	- Too big will damage diodes
	- Too small wont help

## Decoupling

- eliminate any DC voltage from signals in an amplifier circuit
	- blocks dc but allows ac to pass through
	- therefore, dc 

## Bypass

- allows AC signals to bypass $R_E$
	- increase voltage gain across the resistor
	- increase voltage gain of the amplifier
