# Circuit

- A circuit consists of electrical components such as batteries, light bulbs and switches connected together with wires

# Load

- A load is a component which converts the electrical energy supplied by a source into other forms such as light, heat or kinetic energy.

# Open circuit

- Open circuit is a circuit that has a break in its path, thus preventing the continuous flow of current from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a source

## Closed circuit

- Closed circuit is a circuit that has continuous path that allows for the continuous flow of current from the positive terminal to the negative terminal of a source

# Short circuit

- a low resistance path that is usually undesirable and harmful

# Overload

- When current exceeds the current rating of a wire or component
