# USA's role

## Economic strength

### Industrial capabilities

- The USA was the largest industrial producer in the world at the time
- Initially focused on production of consumer goods, but transitioned quickly to military equipment
- Depression left many jobless
	- These people were more willing to work and therefore more effective
	- Compared to forced workers in fascist states

### Sinking of Japanese merchant ships

- The Japanese were not able to protect their ships from being attacked by American Submarines
- The American attacks weakened Japan's economy even further as the war continued

### Contribution of women

- USA: Filled the roles that men previously had. (wartime jobs, Military enlistment, Keep the country running, operate farms)
- Japan and Germany: Only encouraged women to join the work force late into war, by then industries and supply routes alr crippled.
- Working in factories to produce weapons, vehicles & military supplies necessary for the war effort.

## Superior military strength & strategy

### Dolittle Raid

- Intended to fly off of an aircraft carrier and not return
- Bombing raid on Tokyo; considered a spectacuar surprise attack (against the Japanese)
- Was the first good news for the Allies
- Only 14 tons of bombs on key targets
- Crash landed in Allied China

### Battle of Coral Sea

- For the first time, Japanese were halted
- Was more of a stalemate
- First naval air engagement
	- Inexperience on both side

### Battle of Midway

- Island in the middle of nowhere
- Japan tried to bomb and conquer
	- Can be used to attack Hawaii
- Intercepted communications from Japan led to the USA being able to win this battle

## Island hopping (USA)

### Advantages

- Gain control of only the required islands in the Pacific to launch an attack mainland Japan
- Less time and manpower to face all islands

### Disadvantage

- Lost a lot of lives
	- Japanese were more experienced in fighting in those climates
- Drawn out over 3 years

# Desire of a quick victory from the Allies

## Harsh treatments of Prisoners of War (POW)

- Japanese used forced labour to solve its manpower shortage.
- Forced labourers faced harsh conditions, malnutrition and basic health facilities.
- Prisoners-of-war (POWS) were also used as forced labourers.
- The Japanese secret police units (Kempeitai) also tortured the prisoners.
- Japanese hostility towards Allied POWs were highlighted in Allied propaganda.
- This strengthened the determination of the Allied powers to end the war. (link)

## Kamikaze stretegies

- Kamikaze attacks were increasingly used by the Japanese to prevent the US from taking control of Japanese Islands
- Crashing planes into enemy warships with the intention to inflict maximum damage
- Many of the Kamikaze pilots were shot down, landed in the wrong spot, or missed the ships entirely
- Japan was losing more pilots than it could train their replacements

# Allied victory over Europe

## Britain’s entry

• The Far East was low on British strategic priorities throughout 1942-1943; suffered repeated defeats against Japan due to lack of resources’
• Resorted to disruption tactics to break Japanese lines
• Nov 1943 – Admiral Lord Mountbatten took control of SEAC; more men, aircraft, equipment & supplies available
• British fought off Japanese attempt to invade India; Japan lost 60k men
• British regained Burma by May 1945
• Planned to recapture Malaya & Singapore but Japanese surrendered in Aug due to atomic bombs

## USSR

- hastened Japanese's decision to surrender
- 6 Aug: US atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima; Japan did not surrender
- 8 Aug: USSR declares war on Japan; poured 1 million soldiers into Manchuria
- 9 Aug: 2nd atomic bomb dropped on Nagasaki
- Faced with the might of USA's atomic bombs and the USSR’s Red Army, Emperor Hirohito urged the War Council to reconsider surrender

# Atomic Bomb

- Was it really necessary to force Japan to surrender using atomic bombs?

- they didnt have enough planes to shoot down bombers
	- kamikaze left japan with almost no pilots left
	- aa cannot hit high flying bombers
- they didnt foresee that the plane was carrying atomic bombs
	- after being bombed so many times, they thought it was just another raid

## Japanese refusal to surrender

- Because of their code of honor (e.g. fighting to the last person)
- Japan was negotiating surrender but the Americans wanted **unconditional** surrender
- Americans decided to use the bomb to prevent high casualties
	- force unconditional surrender because japan was being too childish

## Soviet Union

- American president was anti-communist
- USA also wanted to end the war in Japan without Soviet help
- USSR was promoting communism to other parts of Europe
- dropping atomic bomb will demonstrate USA's military capabilities and give them a leverage in future meetings and negotiations
