| Hitler’s actions | How it contributed to the outbreak of WWII |
| --- | --- |
| Withdrawal from the LoN & the Geneva Disarmament Conference | This allowed Hitler to pursue his aggressive foreign policy without having to regard the objections and threats from the League, as well as enabled Germany to proceed with rearmament |
| Resumed conscription and rearmament in Germany | Doing so enabled Hitler to rebuild the German military and in turn incrementally further his ambitions of Lebrensraum and the repudiation of the Treaty of Versailles |
| Remilitiarised the Rhineland | The successful remilitarisation of the Rhineland encouraged a further loss of confidence in the League, At the same time, it emboldened Hitler to take additional actions towards achieving his expansionist ambitions |
| Involvement in the Spanish Civil War | This gave Hitler an oppurtunity to test the newly rebuilt German military capability which was important in Hitler’s plans to establish a Greater Germany and create lebensraum. To aggravate matters, the lack of action on the part of the League of Nations strengthened Hitler’s view that Britain and France were weak, which in turn made him more aggressive with his demands. |
| Anschluss with Austria | This allowed Hitler to freely exploit Austria’s resources of gold and iron ore, as well as its army and weapons, all of which were significant to Hitler’s expansionist plans. Furthermore, with the international inaction, it once again encouraged Hitler to believe that he could easily break the Treaty of Versailles and do as he pleased without needing to account for them. Consequently, he would be spurred to take more aggressive action to fulfill his aims. |
| Gained control of the Sudentenland | With Hitler gaining the Sudetenland without having to fight, it encouraged Hitler to be more ambitious in his plans, leading him to set his sights further on occupying the whole of Czechoslovakia |
| Invasion of Poland | This was the immediate spark to the outbreak of WWII, for it finally convinced Britain and France that Hitler could not be trusted, and his quest for expansion could not be stopped with appeasement. This therefore pushed them towards declaring war on Nazi Germany |
