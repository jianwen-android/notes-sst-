# Background to WWI

- Throughout the 1800s, European great powers were competing against each other to increase their wealth and power
- Germany was aggressively expanding after its unification in 1871
    - Germany was new and hadn't existed as a nation until recently then
    - Needed to play catch up as they were a newer European country
- Japan and USA were increasingly powerful at the turn of the 1900s
- There were several outbreaks of wars, civil wars & revolutions throughout the 1800s

## Causes of WWI (TB 3-4)

### Competition for Colonies

- Need colonies for
	- Raw material
	- Cheap/Free labour
	- Land for their empire

### Arms and Naval Race

- Great powers needed better weaponry and ships to protect their faraway colonies
- Anglo-German arms race 1907-1914; both countries announcing the creation of new and improved battleships

### Alliance system

- Throughout the 1800s, powers made multiple secret & publicly known alliances with each other so that they would have assistance in the event of a war.
- The secret alliances cause tensions but also a stalemate as there was a balance of power
- The main alliances in 1914 were:
	- Triple Entente: Britain, Russia & France
	- Triple Alliance: Germany, Austria-Hungary, Italy

### Plans for war (Not in textbook)

- Many countries believed that a major war was about to break out and made very detailed plans to prepare, e.g.
	- Germany: If a war broke out, likely to fight Russia & France but they would be trapped in the middle. 
	- "Schlieffen Plan"
		- quickly attack & defeat France, then focus on Russia who would be likely slower to mobilise
	- Russia: Badly equipped army but able to deploy millions. Planned to overwhelm Germany & Austria-Hungary by sheer numbers
	- France: Plan 17 - French troops charge across the frontier and attack deep into Germany, forcing surrender
	- Britain: Set up British Expeditionary Force (BEF), collaborate with France; activate 150k professional soldiers on short notice
- The existence of these plans and the believe that speed was of essence meant a trigger would lead to immediate war.

###  Nationalism

- Balkan states were part of the Ottoman empire
- As the Empire declined, Balkan states attempted to break free and declare independence
- Austria-Hungary and Russia wanted to assert their influences over the region because of access to the Mediterranean
- Austria-Hungary colonized Bosnia; Russia supported Serbia

## WWI Trigger (Assassination of the Archduke of Austria-Hungary)

- 28 June 1914
- Archduke of Austria-Hungary, Franz Ferdinand
- Archduke Franz Ferdinand & his wife Sophie were visiting Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital
- Shot by Gavrilo Princip
- He was a member of a Serbian nationalist group that pushed for Bosnian independence.
- Kaiser Wilhelm II of Germany gave a 'blank check' to Austria-Hungary, i.e. unconditional support for whatever action Austria-Hungary chose to take in its conflict with Serbia
- Emboldened Austria-Hungary to issue a ten-point ultimatum that would effectively made Serbia a part of the Austria-Hungary empire.
- Serbia rejected the ultimatum
- Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July

# Impact of WWI

## Differing Aims of countries involved

### USA

#### Aims

- Wilson wanted to establish his Fourteen Points as a basis for lasting peace and international cooperation
    - Self-determination
    - Disarmament
    - Establishing the League of Nations

#### Reasons

- Starkly different war experience
- Entered the war late (1917)
- Suffered comparatively little
- The war was not fought on American soil

- Therefore, it was not compelled to seek harsh reparations as they had not suffered as much as compared to the other European countries.
- Wilson wanted a part in the League of Nations and to referee peace for the European countries
- However, the American people wanted to keep the USA out of future foreign entanglements - **isolationism**

### France

#### Aims

- Hoped to reclaim **Alsace-Lorraine**
- Wanted Germany to:
    - Pay **heavy reparations**
    - **Accept total blame** for the war
- Wanted **revenge and compensation** for its war losses

##### Vindictive peace

- Revenge
- Only way to get peace is if you get destroyed

#### Reasons

- France was attacked by Germany twice, in 1970 and 1914 respectively
    - Lost valuable land like Alsace-Lorraine
- Therefore they sought to weaken Germany militarily so as to protect French security

### Britain

#### Aims

- Weaken German navy
- Germany to pay a high price (by the public & Parliament)
- Economically weak but stable Germany

#### Reasons

- Prevent its naval superiority from being threatened by Germany
- Britain suffered large number of casualties during the war
- Germany would be a buffer against Communist Russia & a potential trade partner
    - It would only be a small amount of time before Russia starts spreading its communist ideas around the world
    - Germany needs to be stable so that it does not fall to a communist revolution like Russia

### Italy

#### Aims

- **Rewards promised in the Treaty of London** (1915):
    - Control of Dalmatia
    - Part of Germany's colonies in Asia and Africa
    - Protectorate over Albania
        - Protectorate: Doesn't rule the land but helps to protect and has a say in its policy etc.

#### Reasons

- Joined the war on the side of the Allies due to the promise of territorial gains
- Suffered casualties
- Wanted to restore the Roman empire
- Italy therefore expected its sacrifices to be rewarded as promised

### Japan

#### Aims

- **Control over German possessions in Asia and the Pacific**
- Wanted to be **seen as a world power**
- **Racial equality**

#### Reasons

- **Imperialist ambition**
- To **correct the inequality** it suffered as a result of the unequal treaties
