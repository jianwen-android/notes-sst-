# Containment policy (America)

## Kennan's Long Telegram

8000 word essay on a telegram

9 Feb - Stalin's speech on inherent conflict between communism & capitalism

George Kennan (US Deputy head of American Embassy in USSR) sent the 'Long Telegram' on 22 Feb, which became basis for the US policy of containment

- USSR justified its establishment of Eastern Europe as sphere of influence due to hostile historical experiences of being invaded from the east
- Aggressive expansion by USSR to spread its influence & dominance
- Isolation no longer an option; USA must be involved & adopt global strategy (be prepared to engage world wide) to deal with Soviets
- War not necessary - "long term, patient  but firm & vigilant containment" required

### Containment

- Lessons of WWI - isolation by USA led to European instability
- Did not want to repeat the mistakes post-WWI
- Every Communist action will lead to an American reaction 
	- ensure that USSR did not spread beyond the borders where it was already established
	- also means that you're always being forced to react, no preventive measures
- Containment policy marked clear shift away from isolationism

## The Iron Curtain speech

Winston Churchill speech, helped Americans realised the threat of communism

- Verbalized the ideological & political split
- Symbolic expression of how USSR attempted to prevent its allies from contact with the West
- Strengthened Western views that USSR was hostile & stronger actions were needed from the USA, hence containment

## Truman Doctrine

Formalized set of policies America should use should there be any communist threats

### Origins

- Brtitain crippled by economic crisis
- Civil war in Greece - trouble stirred up by communists
- Possibility of similar uprising in Italy & Turkey
- $ required to strengthen non-Communist governments

### Speech

- 12 March 1947
- "â€¦. it must be the policy of the US to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures"
- pretty much an open criticism and challenged Communism
- urged US to provide financial/military aid to any nations threatened by "armed minorities or by outside pressure"
- e.g. Greece, Turkey
- Domino Theory & Containment

- the United States would provide political, military and economic assistance to all democratic nations under threat from external or internal authoritarian forces

## Marshall Plans

- US recovery program

The US provided economic aid for the reconstruction of war-torn Europe, cause:

1. Believed that economic recovery would stop spread of communism
2. A properous Europe would be a major market for the US-

- 16 Western European states accepted the aid

What type of aid?

- US $13 billion over 4 years
- Technical asssistance - e.g. chemical, engineering & steel industries

### Soviet response

- not accepted
- boycotted the Paris conference
- accepting aid = weakening control over Eastern Europe
- form of US domination: Dependence on US $

marshall plan helped western Europe to recover politially & economically

- Western Europe indebted to USA
- made capitalism more attractive to Eastern European countries
- undermined Soviet authority

## Soviet counter to containment

- tightened control over Eastern Europe
- established Cominform (Communist Information Bureau) in September 1947
- coordinated all communist parties' policies & tactics; minimize trade & contact with non-communist countries
- close supervision of all leaders

- January 1949 - set up Comecon (Council of Mutual Economic Assistance) to coordinate Cominform's economic policies
- H/w, could not match the Marshall Plan in terms of economic aid

# Berlin blockade (June 1948 - May 1949)

## Timeline

### German recovery

- German economy crippled & in chaos
- Could not feed Germans unless industries rebuilt
	- US, BR, FRA combined their zones in 1946 & controlled trade, foreign relations, economy
	- New laws & $ currency introduced in 1948
	- Antagonised Stalin
- Stalin wanted Germany destroyed/crippled but the Allies were helping to rebuild Germany

### Soviet Response

- Stalin was angered by the actions of the Western powers to reunify Germany
	- therefore, decided to blockade the 3 western zones of Berlin
- Official reason - "Prevent devalued Reichsmarks from entering Soviet zone"
- forces the Western powers out of Berlin
	- Western Berlin gives the west legit reason to traverse into East Germany
	- not good cause they can spy and all that
- make Berlin dependant on USSR by starving the people heheheehhhehehhee

### American response

- Harry Truman flew in supplies to the people for 11 months
	- as part of his Doctrine, he promised to help others against communism
- Berlin became a symbol of freedom behind the 'iron curtain'

### Soviet response (or lack of)

- The Soviets did not interfere with the flying in of supplies
	- act of aggression/war
- Stalin removed the blockade after 11 months

## Why the blockade backfired on Stalin

- having setup the blockade on the basis of preventing devalued currency from causing economic chaos
	- Stalin could not afford to shoot down the allied supply planes
	- it would lead to an international backlash

## Other loopholes with the Berlin Blockade

- Excerpt from historian article
	- The blockade was lax & Sovet-area supplies flowed through Berlin's gates, therefore defeating Soviet pressure on Berlin
	- West Berliners could obtain goods in Black & legal markets. Soviet wanted to profit from business with West Berliners who could pay exorbitant prices for food, cigarettes, textiles & luxury goods
	- USA downplayed the leackages in the blockade to emphasize their own role
	- Airlift provided enough food, coal to meet basic household needs; However, without Soviet area goods, West Berlin's economy would have collapsed

## Effects of the Bloackade

### 1. Increased hostility between the two blocs

- Failure of the blockade humiliated USSR
- boosted US credibility & displayed their technological edge
	- didnt kill anyone while dropping food
	- converted WW2 planes to airdrop supplies
- soviet act of aggression resolved French misgivings about helping to strengthen Western zones of Germany

### 2. Divided Germany into two

- 3 western zones merged to form the German Federal Republic (West Germany)
- Soviet zone became the German Democratic Republic (East Germany)

### 3. Berlin blockade showed the West that they needed to cooperate to stop Soviet aggression

- Led to the formation of NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, April 1949)

#### NATO agreement

- an armed attack against one member would be taken as an attack against them all
- became a safeguard against Soviet Expansion into Western Europe

### 4. The Warsaw Pact (1955)

- to counter NATO
	- USSR signed a mutual defence treaty with her Eastern European satellites
	- Military complement to Cominform & Comecon
	- H/w, it was seen as an attempt by the USSR to strengthen hold over satellite states #question h/w?
