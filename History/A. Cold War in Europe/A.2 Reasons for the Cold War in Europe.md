> [!Question] How did the Cold War impact the world order in the post-1945 years

# Idealogy conflict between the USA and the Soviet Union

## USA

- belief in **self-determination** (freedom)
- by the people, of the people, for the people
- free market

## Soviet Union

- belief in a utopian society after world wide revolution (equality for all)
- communist party centralizes all power; One party state
- command economy

## Why were the 2 systems unable to co-exist?

- Marx's theory that all Capitalist class will one day be over-pushed by Working class (Class struggle)
- Capitalist fear of the Domino Theory - must prevent at any cost
- Led to deep mistrust/ conflicts between both systems
- E.g. Post-WWII Communist parties in Russia, Italy, Germany, Poland, Greece, etc.

# Breaking down of Wartime alliances

- The alliance between USSR, USA & Britain lasted from 1941 - 1945
- It was clearly a temporary relationship of convenience / mutual benefit
- Several disagreements broke out during negotiations for a post-war settlement
- 1945: Conflict during conferences to solve WWII Issues

## The Yalta conference (feb ‘45)

- Germany was losing the war
- Allied leaders met to plan what would happen to Europe
- Stalin, Roosevelt & Churchill had differences but agreed on SOME important matters.

### Important terms agreed on

1. Stalin enters war against Japan once Germany surrenders
2. Germany to be divided into 4 zones: US, Fra, BRi, USSR. German capital-berlin divided into 4 too
3. Hunt down & punish Nazi war criminals
4. Countries occupied by Germany would hold free elections for govt
5. Big 3 joined UNO, which aimed to keep peace after WWII
6. Eastern Europe = Soviet sphere of influence

### Positive Effects:

- Allies learn lesson of Versailles
- International cooperation through United Nations Organisation

### Problems:

- US and Britain worried about Eastern Europe falling to communism
    

## The Postadam Conference (Jul - Aug 1945)

- 30 Apr 1945: Hitler commited suicide
- European front won    
- 2nd Conference held in potsdam (Berlin)
- Now that Germany was defeated, no more common enemy
- Major changes that affected relationships b/w the leaders
- Aug ‘45
- Britain: Churchill lost in an election to Clement Attlee halfway through Potsdam Conference
- Attlee was a conservative focussed on rebuilding Britain

### Problematic Changes

#### 1. Stalin armies were occupying most of Eastern Europe

- Soviet troops did not withdraw after freeing the countries: Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania
- Stalin sets up communist govt in Poland despite protests
- Insisted it was a defensive measure

#### 2. America had a new president

- 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died. Replaced by Harry Truman
- Roosevelt was willing to recognize Soviet sphere of influence while Truman was unwilling
- Anti-Communist, suspicious of Stalin
- Felt Stalin was trying to take over Europe
- Critisized soviet policy in Poland and cut off the lend lease aid program

#### 3. Allies had tested an atomic bomb

- 16 July 1945, Truman informed Stalin about tests (bomb was a veiled threat to USSR to gain leverage in negotiations) and no longer needed Soviet help against Japan
- Stalin felt threatened & was more determined to challenge US
- USSR successfully detonated its 1st atomic bomb in August 1949, sparking an arms race

### Effect of Disputes

- The Potsdam Conference ended without complete agreement on these issues
- Over 9 months, Stalin dominated Eastern Europe
- All had Communist governments
- These countries became satellite states, with policies heavily influenced by USSR
- The West criticised USSR for the suppression of freedom and hostile takeovers

# Power vacuum in Europe

## What was the state of Europe?

- Europe was devastated by WWII
- 40 million dead
- Buildings, infrastructures reduced to rubble
- Refugees of war relocating to find new homes
- Agricultural & industrial outputs havled
- Govts bankrupt
- Govts & empires collapsed

### (Past) Great powers?

- Germany, Italy, France & Britian were no longer able to dominate politics/post-war decisions (textbook pg 12)
- Needed outside help to rebuild

## What was the role of USA & USSR

- This allowed USA & USSR to compete for a role in reconstructing Europe, increasing their political & economic influence
	- USA emerged from WWII virtually unscathed - with a powerful military & economy
	- USSR built a sphere of incluence
- Both started to assert themselves trying to shape post-war Europe
- USA and USSR clashed over security needs and ideological beliefs
- Both sought to strengthen its economic & political influence in Europe

### USSR

- feared encirclement by capitalist Europe;
	- which would threaten its security & survival

### USA

- feared loss of influence and having to face a continent that was ideologically hostile

## Result

- Stalin established a ring of satellites states through the use of ‘salami tactics’ (often formed coalitions, win, slice away bits of coalition through suspicious means until Soviet piece left)
	- To Stalin, this was a defensive measure to protect USSR & its sphere of influence
	- To Western powers, this was USSR aggressively expanding global communist influence
- USA containment
