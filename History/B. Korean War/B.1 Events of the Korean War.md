# Context

## Division of Korea

- Korea was ruled by Japan from 1910 to 1945 at the end of the World War
- Potsdam conference (before the war ended), the Allies unilaterally decided to divide Korea, without consulting Koreans
- 8 sept 1945, US set the 38th parallel, control South Korea via the United States Army Military Government in Korea
	- Soviet Union controlled North Korea
- was supposed to be a temporary division; North Korea held "free" elections to reunite Korea

## Start of Cold War

- US and USSR met from 1946-1947 to determine hwo to govern Korea
- no agreeement reached
- US feared USSR dominance over Korea
- 1948 - UN temporary commission on Korea held elections south of 38th parallel
	- Communists boycotted elections (felt that it was unfair for elections to be in the South)

- Sought to unify Korea - appealed to Stalin 3 times to help rebuild North Korea and wage war against South

## Military imbalance (in North Korea's favour)

- by 1949, both US & USSR withdrew from the Korean Peninsula, as agreed in the Potsdam Conference
- However, USSR left a well-trained and equipped North Korean army with Soviet  tanks and artillery
- US did not want the South to launch a full-scale invasion of North Korea & left behind a small force, poorly trained & poorly equipped

- Other developments
	- USSR achieved **atomic parity** in August 1949
		- no more fear of US when supporting North Korea
	- Sino-Soviet alliance: USSR could avoid direct intervention in Korea, with China available to help

### US

- US saw Korea as less important than the Western bloc
- In a key speech on the US defense perimeter in Jan 1950, Korea was not mentioned by the US Secretary of State about which countries US was prepared to defend in the Asia-Pacific
- US prioritised Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines, the Ryukyu & Aleutian islands
