- 8 sept 1945, US set the 38th parallel, control South Korea via the United States Army Military Government in Korea
	- Soviet Union controlled North Korea
- was supposed to be a temporary division; North Korea held "free" elections to reunite Korea

## Start of Cold War

- US and USSR met from 1946-1947 to determine hwo to govern Korea
- no agreeement reached
- US feared USSR dominance over Korea
- 1948 - UN temporary commission on Korea held elections south of 38th parallel
	- Communists boycotted elections (felt that it was unfair for elections to be in the South)

### Kim Il Sung

- Created a cult of personality in North Korea
- Sought to unify Korea - appealed to Stalin 3 times to help rebuild North Korea and wage war against South

## Military imbalance (in North Korea's favour)

- by 1949, both US & USSR withdrew from the Korean Peninsula, as agreed in the Potsdam Conference
- However, USSR left a well-trained and equipped North Korean army with Soviet  tanks and artillery
- US did not want the South to launch a full-scale invasion of North Korea & left behind a small force, poorly trained & poorly equipped
- Kim needed USSR approval to invade South Korea
- At this point, Stalin did not want any direct involvement in Korea
	- Prevent being entagled in war with the US
	- US still had atomic advantage at this time

## Strategic imbalance

- Both US & USSR had differing views on the importance of Korea
- USSR saw Korea as important to its expansion of global influence
- China was the only Soviet ally in the Asia-pacific in 1949 after CCP victory over KMT
- Korea would act as counterbalance to US influence in Japan
- Other developments
	- USSR achieved **atomic parity** in August 1949:no more fear of USA when supporting North Korea
	- Sino-Soviet allieance: USSR could avoid direct intervention in Korea, with China available to help

- US saw Korea as less important than the Western bloc
- In a key speech on the US defense perimeter in Jan 1950, Korea was not mentioned by the US Secretary of State about which countries US was prepared to defend in the Asia-Pacific
- US prioritized Japan, Taiwan, the Philipines, the Ryukyu & Aleutian islands
- If an attack occurred on other areas not identified by the Americans, the locals should rely on themselves to resist it and wait for the UN to help.
