# Both South and North Korea was in ruin

- Over 2,000,000 people of South Korea and UN lost their lives and 2,500,000 people of North Korea and China died
- Korean peninsula remains divided; North Korea with communist government and South Korea with democratic government
- The tensions between USA and USSR became even worse
- Soviet Union, with the reason that they did not participate in the war actively, got criticised by other communist countries, lost its influence over North Korea and adversarial relationship formed between USSR and China

# Expansion of Cold War beyond Europe

- Set precedence for Proxy Wars
- 1st time fought using third parties as substitutes for direct confrontation between USA & USSR
- USA & USSR used propaganda & aid to countries in other continents, e.g. Vietnam, Cuba, Middle East, Angola, Afghanistan (Pg 64-65)
- Smaller countries were not always controlled by USSR and USA

# Intensified US involvement in the Asia-Pacific

- Saw USSR & China as a monolithic block, a united entity
- Believed USSR was planning to take over Asia-Pacific
- If one country was lost to communism, others would be lost too ([[A.3 How did the East & West battle over the Cold War#Domino Theory]])
- USA intensified support for economic reconstruction of Japan
- Japan became a key US ally in Asia & the model of democracy in Asia. Produced uniforms, equipment, supplies for US forces thus recovering economically

# Escalation of military tensions between communist & Western bloc in Europe
