selection criteria

- meet demands of people
	- better working conditions
	- standard of living, education and medical services
- renewal of USSR

### Economic changes

#### Ending of Central planning

> [!note] What is central planning
> Prior to Gorbachev, factories were told what to produce by the central planning committee. 

- Law of Enterprise 1989
	- market forces decide on the type and price of goods and wages of workers
- allowed managers to make profit

**Problem**
- too overwhelming
	- managers had no idea where to start
	- no market research (cause central planning)
- central government was too powerful and remained in charge

#### Market Economy introduced

- encouraged workers to own and run small businesses in spare time
- foreign companies and trading allowed to set up
- ideally, important economic decisions left to individuals & businesses
	- the rational was that these people were faster and more flexible than the government

#### Military spending reduced

- USSR was world's biggest manufacturer of tanks, guns and weapons in 1980
- reduce military budget allowed resources to be spent on other parts of economy
- Gorbachev announced removed of Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and Afghanistan in 1988
- Reduction of subsidies to Warsaw Pact countries
	- not interfere in governments
	- promote arms reductions

### Foreign policy reforms

- Gorbachev was very popular in the West for his 'New thinking'
- Talks of weapons reduction were not just rhetoric (INF treaty)
- USSR need not be a military balance/destroy capitalist West
- had close working relationship with Reagan and USA

#### Loosening Soviet control over Eastern Europe (De-ideologisation)

- 'Sinatra Doctrine'
	- announced the end of Soviet assistance for Eastern Europe to concentrate on tackling internal problems
	- was called that by commentators cause of the line in Frank Sinatra song: "and I did it my way"
- allowed the countries to determine their own affairs
- Glasnost meant that Red Army would not be sent in should the people over turn communist governments
- repeated his speech in December 1988 during UN meeting
- 50k USSR troops unilaterally withdrawn from Eastern Europe
	- essentially demobilised and jobless
- allow foreign media and tv broadcast
- continued dialogue with USA to promote peace and nuclear disarmament

#### Soviet control over Eastern Europe

- dramatically brought Iron Curtain to an end
	- abandoned Brezhnev Doctrine
		- no one can leave the Warsaw pact
		- cause it will threaten USSR security
	- anti-reformist were against it as the USSR was historically invaded through the west
- from Jun 1989 - Oct 1990, communist governments were swept out of power
	- got violent
- newly established governments established diplomatic ties with capitalist countries immediately
	- those that broke free immediately joined the UN
		- if they were invaded again by the USSR, UN could protect them
- soviet republics were in unrest (see [[#Multi-ethnic nature of Soviet Union]])
	- those "countries" under the USSR (Ukraine, Kazakhstan etc.)

# Reasons for failure

## Speed of reforms

- deeply entrenched problem's which could not be solved with quick measures
- system could not cope with all types of problems at one shot
	- where to begin?
- people found the reforms frightening
	- did not want reforms
	- anti-reformists deliberately slowed down changes
- had to rely on themselves to achieve a profit or risk losing their jobs/factories (10% workforce drunk)
- no subsidies + high expectation = high prices of goods

## Size of Problem

- huge country
	- difficult to implement changes across whole country
- problems ran from agriculture all the way to the officials in the administration
	- managers were inefficient and corrupt
- factories not energy-efficient
	- costly repairs/improvements required
- no support system available for new products
	- warehouses, transport, shops to sell items

## Lack of support from West

- though Gorbachev was popular with the West, he did not receive much financial aid from them
	- they did not see a guarantee on returns
- Gorbachev was awarded a nobel peace prize in 1990
- but moral support was not enough to drive reforms

## Opposition from communist hardliners (anti-reformers)

- went against principles of communism from his economic reforms
	- lost much support within the central government by 1990
- Glasnost and perestroika
	- reduce state intervention and power of bureaucracy
- endangered security of country and Warsaw Pact
- group of hardliners attempted a coup against him and had Gorbachev placed under house arrest in 1991

## Opposition from Soviet People

- workers expected results and improved conditions before working harder
- pro-Gorbachev supporters were disappointed at slow pace of reforms
- short term problems
	- unemployment and wage cuts: extremely unpopular
- Gorbachev criticised heavily for Glasnost policy

### Discredit of Communist regime

- failings of communist government and atrocities of Stalin's era were exposed
	- e.g. problems with housing, food shortages, high mortality rates, Stalin's purges
- democracy was new and public were not comfortable with the concept of freedom of choice
- Glasnost turned people against communism, not support it

## Multi-ethnic nature of Soviet Union

- Glasnost and Perestroika led to rise of nationalism as Soviet Union was made up of 15 republics
- reforms then led to many voicing their unhappiness at being dominated by Russian
- the central authority and the red army, were also too weak to control the whole empire from the capital, Moscow
