# Background

## Soviet leaders

1. **Joseph Stalin**
2. **Khrushchev**
3. Brehznev
4. Andropov (1.5 years before dying)
5. Chernenko (1 year before dying)
6. Gorbachev (this time the Soviet Union dies)

### Why they die

- cause it takes time for them to rise through the ranks
- by the time people thought they were suitable candidates to lead, they were old af no cap on god fr fr 100%

## US-Soviet Relations

- Détente - initiated by Nixon & Kissinger
	- led to reduction of tensions
- End of détente - USSR's invasion of Afghanistan led to cancellation of arms limitation talks & US embargo on grain & technology
- Appointments of Thatcher & Reagan led to confrontational attitude against the USSR

## US's economic & military superiority

- Reagan's economic liberalisation policies led to economic growth in the 1980s
	- Individual enterprise encouraged instead of people relying on govt. for goods & services
	- Cutting national budgets, selling off national assets to private companies, e.g. phone companies, oil companies, airlines
	- controversial policy

### How did US economic boom pose a threat to the USSR?

- Reagan renewed the arms race & pressured the USSR to keep up with military expenditure & production
- e.g. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI/Star Wars)
- NATO stationed >100 Pershing II missiles in West Germany aimed at USSR;
- Able Archer 1983

- Both countries were on the brink of a nuclear war; Reagan was forced to scale down his evil empire rhetoric due to public pressure

## Structure of State

- pure communism is achieved when state control is withered
	- e.g. no government required
- In reality, the Communist Party never through their people were ready
- Created a bureaucracy to run the country, with a single leader in charge of the Politburo
- leaders dictate to the Politburo what to do
- used KGB (Committee for State Security in English) and bureaucracy to ensure policies were carried out according to state plans
- The structure was heavily dependant on the **leadership and system**
- Severe problems encountered in 1980s due to poor health of leaders
