# Background

2. **Khrushchev**
3. Brehznev
4. Andropov (1.5 years before dying)
5. Chernenko (1 year before dying)
6. Gorbachev (this time the Soviet Union dies)

## US-Soviet Relations

- Détente - initiated by Nixon & Kissinger
	- led to reduction of tensions
- End of détente - USSR's invasion of Afghanistan led to cancellation of arms limitation talks & US embargo on grain & technology
- Appointments of Thatcher & Reagan led to confrontational attitude against the USSR

## US's economic & military superiority
- Reagan's economic liberalisation policies led to economic growth in the 1980s
	- Individual enterprise encouraged instead of people relying on govt. for goods & services
	- Cutting national budgets, selling off national assets to private companies, e.g. phone companies, oil companies, airlines
	- controversial policy
