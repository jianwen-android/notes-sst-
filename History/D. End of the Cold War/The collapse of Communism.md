> [!question] Why did it happen so fast?

# Background

## Soviet leaders

1. **Joseph Stalin**
2. **Khrushchev**
3. Brehznev
4. Andropov (1.5 years before dying)
5. Chernenko (1 year before dying)
6. Gorbachev (this time the Soviet Union dies)

### Why they die

- cause it takes time for them to rise through the ranks
- by the time people thought they were suitable candidates to lead, they were old af no cap on god fr fr 100%

## US-Soviet Relations

- Détente - initiated by Nixon & Kissinger
	- led to reduction of tensions
- End of détente - USSR's invasion of Afghanistan led to cancellation of arms limitation talks & US embargo on grain & technology
- Appointments of Thatcher & Reagan led to confrontational attitude against the USSR

## US's economic & military superiority

- Reagan's economic liberalisation policies led to economic growth in the 1980s
	- Individual enterprise encouraged instead of people relying on govt. for goods & services
	- Cutting national budgets, selling off national assets to private companies, e.g. phone companies, oil companies, airlines
	- controversial policy

### How did US economic boom pose a threat to the USSR?

- Reagan renewed the arms race & pressured the USSR to keep up with military expenditure & production
- e.g. Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI/Star Wars)
- NATO stationed >100 Pershing II missiles in West Germany aimed at USSR;
- Able Archer 1983

- Both countries were on the brink of a nuclear war; Reagan was forced to scale down his evil empire rhetoric due to public pressure

## Structure of State

- pure communism is achieved when state control is withered
	- e.g. no government required
- In reality, the Communist Party never through their people were ready
- Created a bureaucracy to run the country, with a single leader in charge of the Politburo
- leaders dictate to the Politburo what to do
- used KGB (Committee for State Security in English) and bureaucracy to ensure policies were carried out according to state plans
- The structure was heavily dependant on the **leadership and system**
- Severe problems encountered in 1980s due to poor health of leaders

## Economic conditions

### Capitalist

- your demand affects policies and decisions

### Communist

- what the government decides, the government gets
- much of the money spent was not beneficial to the citizens

#### Poor/slow decisions by central government

- did not make good decisions
	- unaware of ground conditions in different parts of USSR
- factory managers had to wait for government decisions for everything (what to produce)

#### No quality control

- focus was on heavy industries
	- not possible to measure quality
- consumer goods produced were often

#### No incentive to work hard/alcoholism

- No rewards to work harder
- Jobs were guaranteed for life; subsidised health care, housing & education
- Vodka was cheap & easily obtained
- Many workers went to work drunk

#### Excessive budget allocated for military

- Almost 50% of government spending was on military
- Investment not used to upgrade technology in agricultural sector/industries
- Poor transportation & distribution system
	- factories located far from raw materials; farm productions rotted while waiting for transport

### Under Khrushchev

- The command economy had reached its maximum potential under Stalin's leadership
	- Stalin had already introduced industrialisation and collectivisation
	- So Khrushchev had to come up with new ideas
- Khrushchev tried to introduce a number of economic reforms but had failed to boost the stagnant economy

#### Agriculture

- Vrigin lands scheme
	- solve food shortages by growing wheat in central USSR
	- e.g. Siberia
- involved huge manpower & costs but the climate 
- Involved huge manpower & costs but the climate & soil were unsuitable; Lacked transportation
- Massive failure

#### Industries

- broke up central control & introduced a council of national economy to manage 100 districts 
	- tried to improve efficiency
- rate of industrial growth dropped consistently
- problems blamed on Khrushchev

### Under Brezhnev

- Politburo voted Khrushchev out of power over economic & political problems
- Abandoned economic experiments; returned to Stalinist style of control economy
- Heavy emphasis on heavy industry again
- However, economy continued to slide – required loans from the West! (during détente)

### Gorbachev’s challenges

- ‘Global over-stretch’: Gave financial & military aid to left-wing regimes in Africa; spent millions on Red Army to support Warsaw Pact allies & US$ 3b a year to Eastern European states (thru COMECON); fighting in Afghanistan still on-going 
- Economy stagnated since 1975, req’d technological & financial aid from the West 
- Half of the industries operated at a loss

## Social conditions

### Under Khrushchev

- Tried to provide more freedom, consumer goods & invited a comparison of capitalism & communism (successfully introduced housing initiative)
- State system could not cope with his changes & upset many people
- People increasingly disillusioned 
	- destalinisation backfired

### Growing anti-Soviet feelings in republics & within communist bloc
- USSR created out of 15 countries
- Varying ethnic groups with unique languages, customs and religion
- Resented being ruled by the Communist party
- Control established using Soviet troops, which was another costly financial drain

## How Gorbachev attempts to revive the system
