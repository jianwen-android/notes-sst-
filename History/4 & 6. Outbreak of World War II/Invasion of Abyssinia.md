Dec 1934: Dispute between Abyssinia & Italy (in Somalia). Abyssinian Empeoer Haile Selassie appealed to the League for help.

3 Oct 1935: Using the dispute as a pretext, Italy invaded Abyssinia. This breached the League of Nations covenant.

💀 Mussolini sent his daughter to ask British and French officials what they thought of war. No one batted an eye

# Measures taken by the LoN

Imposed an embargo on certain products to Italy but delayed ban on sale of oil as it did not want to hurt the economic interests of League members.

Even if they did embargo, Americans have been and could have kept selling oil to the Italians

# Measures taken by the Britain and France

...?

# The Hoare-Laval Pact

## Reasons

### Stresa Front Pact

- 3 countries
- Britain, France and Italy formed an alliance to punish Germany for breaking the treaty of Versailles
    - Were allies with Italy in the Stresa Front, so did not want to offend Mussolini
- Did not close the Suez Canal to Italian ships - Italy could ship war supplies to Abyssinia

### Weakened military

- hard to justify spending money on military to go to another war
    - especially after fighting a war and losing military + economy
    - citizens cared a lot more about their own lives
- if politicians talked about going to war, they would be unpopular and not be voted

### France

- France had always relied on Italy for help against Germany

### Stuff happened

Laval and Hoare were British and French officials, whose countries were seen as big members of the League

Outcome

- Information about the pact was leaked to the press and the public reaction was one of anger. Laval and Hoare were made to resign and the League’s reputation was damaged beyond repair

Significance

- It showed that Britain and France was willing to undermine the League to protect their own intersts.
- The League was supposed to protect smaller countries, but Italy was given the rights to Abyssinian land after its aggressive actions.

# Overall outcome

## Abyssinia

9 May 1936: Italy conquered Abyssinia (2/3s agreed on in the Hoare-Laval Pact)

Nov 1936: Mussolini and Hitler signed a treaty of friendship, establishing the Rome-Berlin Axis.

Peace was established between Britain, France and Italy

<aside>
☠️ Mussolini felt his interest were more aligned to Hitler after the British and French disassociated themselves from their planned invasion of Abyssinia, essentially backstabbing him.

</aside>

## Germany

- Convinced Hitler that the League would be unable to stop his ambitious plans for expansion

## League of Nations

- Loss of faith
    - Shows big powers that you could get away unpunished as long as you are aggressive
    - Shows smaller countries that they could be backstabbed and was not protected

Collective security was shown to be an empty promise

<aside>
☠️ The League of Nations had failed
