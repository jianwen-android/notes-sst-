## Fear of another war similar to WWI

- WWI affected Britain and France tremendously; est 2.2 million dead & 6.3 million wounded
- Public disgust towards war meant that countries could not afford to rearm
    - How do you go to war without your people fighting for/with you
- When Hitler remilitarised Rhineland, the public did not bother
    - Lol its just German land and they’re protecting themselves bro calm down
- Chamberlain was heralded as a hero post-Munich conference

- France
    - over-valued currency;
    - political unrest

## USA Isolation and the need to buy time

- The British & French governments privately believed that war may be necessary but did not believe they were strong enough to take on Germany
- After WWI, they had not spent sufficiently to maintain their military
- Could not rely on USA for help as USA was in isolation

- Chamberlain believed that Hitler did not have unlimited aims and would cease making demands once he was able to revise the ToV
