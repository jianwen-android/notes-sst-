[[League of Nations|Structure of the League of Nations]]

Which 1 is the most important?

1.  Weaknesses of the League
2. Hitler’s expansionist policy
3. Policy of Appeasement

# Failures of the LoN

1. Promote disarmament
2. Promote collective security

## Disarmament

- The League was unable to achieve much success in disarmament
- Success achieved in disarmament was achieved through the efforts of individual major European powers and not the League
    - American Washington Naval Conference (1921)
    - German Locarno Treaties (1925)

### Major powers

- Refused to cooperate when the League organised major disarmament conferences in 1926 and the 1930s
- Did not trust each other and placed their own national interests above international peace.

| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Washington Naval Conference (1921) | No                       | Yes      | Set a ratio for tonnage of capital ships among major powers<br>USA:BR:JP:ITA  :FRA<br>5     :5   :3  :1.67:1.67 |
| Locarno Treaties (1925) | No | Hmm | Terms of the Treaty of Versailles accepted by the Weimar government |
| League Commission to prepare for World Disarmament Conference (1926) | Yes | No | Britain and France refused to cooperate |
| Kellogg-Briand Pact (1928) | No | No | Agreement that conflicts should be resolved in a peaceable manner. However, no clear way to enforce pact |
| World Disarmament Conference | Yes | No | Germany insisted other powers should match its disarmament level.<br>France refused to limit its own armaments.<br>Britain and USA refused to commit to the level requested by France.<br>Germany withdrew from the Conference and the League |

Unwillingness to disarm and compromise meant that no meaningful progress could be made by the League towards disarmament

This led to a general atmosphere of distrust and tension that would ultimately lead to...

# Examples of failures
