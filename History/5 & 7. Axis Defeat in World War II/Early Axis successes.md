# Europe: reasons for german success

## Germany

- Started prepatations for war when Hitler came to power
- Wehrmacht was much more equipped with superior firepower
- Luftwaffe was best of its kind in 1939
- Blitzkreig (lightning war) used to devastating effect

## Britain, France & allies

- Due to the Great Depression, did not start rearming till late 1930s
- Obsolete WWI equipment
	- e.g. France 131/634 planes & nearly all 400+ bombers were obsolete

## Blitzkreig

1. Dive bombers attack key targets, e.g. roads, railway stations, airfields to destroy enemy communications
2. Tanks & motorized artillery punch holes in enemy line; isolate segments of enemy; surrounded & captured by infantry divisions
3. Large number of troops move in, travelling as fast as possible

# Asia-pacific (AP): Reasons for Japanese success

- WWII in Europe - Britain & France were too busy fighting Germany to defend their colonies in Asia
- All available resources were redeployed
- Japanese troops were battle-hardened (fighting since 1937 Sino-Japanese War) vs Inexperienced Allied troops (British soldiers had never fought in jungles)
- Both Britain & France underestimated the Japanese militaryâ€™s capabilities & use of blitzkreig

 (Faced) Brutality during WWII

# Germans

- Attempted racial annihilation of Jews, Russians
- Other victims often included gypsies, patients with disabilities
- Extreme cruelty to Soviet POW

# Japanese

- Kempeitai - use of torture, mass executions to instill fear amongst locals
- Notable crimes included:
    - Sandakan death marches
    - Forcing women of occupied territories to serve as sex workers
    - Death railway
    - Biological & chemical testing on POW & civilians
- In early 1942, Germany & Japan looked invincible with much of Europe & asia occupied by the Axis Powers
- Britain & the USSR barely survived onslaughts while USA was just getting started
- However, the tide turned by late 1942 as both Germany and Japan started experiencing setbacks
- By April 1945 Hitler committed suicide; Germany surrendered in May
- Japan announced its surrender in August & officially did so in September 1945
