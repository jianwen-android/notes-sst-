# Aims

- Treaty of Versailles
    - Hated the Treaty
    - Promised to abolish it
- Greater Germany
    - Wanted lost German territories
        - Unite with Austria
        - Create Lebensraum e.g. Russia, Poland
- Hitler vs Communism
    - Anti-Communist
    - Believed be Bolsheviks should be destroyed
- Racial superiority
    - Exterminate inferior races, e.g. Slavs, Jews

# Step 1

- After withdrawing from the Geneva Disarmament Conference, he began *secret rearmament and conscription from 1933-34*
- When the Allies found out in 1935
    - France protested but was not willing to impose sanctions/take further actions without British support
    - British thought it was ok cause they claimed self defence + was giving jobs amidst the great depression
- 1935 June - Britain sings *Anglo-German Naval agreement*; allowing Germany to build up their navy to 1/3 of the British fleet

# Step 2

- France & USSR signed Franco-Soviet Pact in response to German remilitarisation
- Hitler claimed that he should be able to remilitarised Rhineland and defend German land, under the threat of this new pact
- Hitler took a gamble that Britain and France would not respond
- The League was preoccupied with the Abyssinian crisis & did nothng except verbally condemn his actions
- Made Hitler look bold and respectable

# Step 3

- Hitler sent soldiers, equipment and war planes to support Spanish Nationalist forces vs. Communists in the Spanish Civil War in 1937
- He justified involvement using a common hatred for communism
- Britain, France & the League therefore took no action

# Step 4

- Many Austrian-born Germans supported political union between Germany & Austria since late 1800s
- Hitler encouraged Austrian Nazis to stir up trouble & push for union
- Pressured Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg
- A plebiscite was conducted; During the voting, Hitler sent troops to ‘keep peace’
- 99.75% voted for Anschluss
- Austria annexed 13 Mar 1938

# Step 5

## Sudetenland & Czechoslovakia

- Due to ToV, the population of Sudetenland was largely ethnic Germans
- Hitler insitigated the Nazi Party in Sudetenland to stir up trouble
- When the Czech govt. suppressed the troublemakers, Hitler threatened to go to war to protect the ethnic Germans
- Czechoslovakia had a modern army and all its defensive forts were in Sudetenland
- Sudetenland also had important industrial resources
- Czech President was willing to go to war with Germany; protected by Franco-Soviet Pact
- However, Britain was keen to avert war
- Neville Chamberlain went to Germany on his accord to meet HItler in Sept 1938
    - First meeting: Agreed on a plebiscite; allow people of Sudetenland to decide whom to belong to
    Chamberlain returns home and convinces France & Czechoslovakia to agree, albeit reluctantly
    - Second meeting: Hitler changes tune, demands for ALL of Sudetenland & all Germans to return;
    Chamberlain rejects. Britain and France preps for war
- Italy chairs the Munich Conference on 29 Sept 1938, inviting Britain, France & Germany to a meeting in order to avoid war
- Sudetenland was conceded to Germany; Britain & Germany re-affirm their friendship and desire to never to go war
- Chamberlain went home a public hero - ‘peace with honour.... peace in our time’
- Churchill called the Munich Agreement - ‘a total, unmitigated defeat’
- Czechoslovakia & USSR were not consulted; Britain informed Czech leaders if they did not accept the Agreement, they would face Germany along
- Edvard Benes resigned; German soldiers marched into Sudetenland on 1 October
- 16 March 1939: Germany invaded the rest of Czechosskovakia
- Britain and France finallly reaised that Hitler could not be trusted, went to war with them

# Rhineland

## March 1936

German troops marched into demilitarised Rhineland

### Risky

- French resistance?
    - War?
- French outnumbered Germans
    - German army not ready despite having remilitarised
- German generals not happy
- Retreat if met with any resistance by the French

## French and British Reaction

### French

- protested but not fight
    - sticking and relying on best bud Britain
- maginot line

### British

- “well this is German territory”
- British politician: ‘two hoots’ about Rhineland
- not enough to go to war over ([[Appeasement Policy]])

# Anschluss (German takeover of Austria)

- 1938 crisis: Austrian Nazis
    - Wanted to be united with Nazi Germany
- Kurt Schuschnigg - minister of Austria at the time

## Meeting with Hitler

- Met with Hitler, who demanded power for Austrian Nazis
    - Threatened to invade Austria
        - No other state would dare to point out Germany “settling” its border problems
        - In theory, nothing was stopping him from invading Austria and getting away with it
    - Boi he was hella angry
    - Could only pretend to agree with Hitler to avoid fighting

## Plebiscite

- March 1938: Schuschnigg announces plebiscite *(vote to remain independant or merge with Germany)*
- Voting age 24
    - Quite high intentionally because most radical Nazis were young
    - Hitler saw this and did not want to risk the vote going against him → invasion

## Invasion

- 11 March: German army invaded
- No resistance from the Austrian army
    - Some cheering crowds, some support
    - However there were people who did not agree with the takeover
        - Vienna: 76,000 “potential enemies of the Nazi regime” were arrested
- 12 March: Hitler visits
---

### Was Hitler a peacemaker? (No)

- Talked of new plans for peace
- new 25 year agreement between Germany, France and Belgium
- Joining the League of Nations again

> Hitler smacked his enemy in the face and as he did so he declared ‘I bring you proposals of peace’
