# Economic impact

- Stalin wanted to modernise the Soviet Union to achieve the same economic and military levels as the Western powers
- This was to be done through the 5 year plans
	- They each set targets for industrial and agricultural development
	- Rapiud industrialisation and collectivisation was to work together

## Collectivisation

- merge or "collectivise" smaller individual farms into larger collective farms or kolkhozy
- based on the belief that larger units of land could be farmed more efficiently through mechanisation, the use of machines
	- e.g. using tractors
- considered a reversal of Lenin's NEP (New Economic Policy)
- by 1935 almost all the farms were collectivised

### Effects

- actually hampered the development of the agricultural sector
- only in the 1950s did the agricultural production only regained the original efficiency of 1928

### NEP (1921 - 1928) vs Collectivisation (1928 onwards)

#### Aims

##### NEP

- Improve the Soviet economy
- which was devastated following the Russian Revolution and the civil war

##### Collectivisaion

- was more in line with Communist ideology of the party
- Aid in Stalin's main aim of rapid industrailisation
	- promises a secure food supply for the factory workers
	- creates excess crops that can be exported to other countries to raise funds for industrialisation
	- makes farming more efficient, allowing more farmers to work as factory workers instead

#### Measures

##### NEP

- farmers allowed to posses their own land
- could plant crops on it for personal use and sell extra crops for profit

##### Collectivisaion

- Land owned by the state
- Distribute crops grown, equally
- Workers had quotas of crops to produce within their set working hours
	- paid with wages
	- provided equipment like tractors
	- all set by the state
- farmers who produced low quantities or were absent were punished
