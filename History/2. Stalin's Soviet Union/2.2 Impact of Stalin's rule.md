 What happened?

# Collectivisation â†’ Industrialisation

80% of Russia's populace were peasants

- Comply
    - Surrendered land and food
        - Land was given to the state for industrialisation
        - Food was sold **overseas**
    - You starve lol
        - Cannibalism just cause
    - 11 million deaths
- Don't comply
    - Eat what you can, burn what you can't
        - Executed
        - Sent to purges
            - Labelled as Kulaks
    - 3 - 4 million deaths

# Stalin's purges

## 1. Party

- They voted against him
	- They saw what he did with Russia during the collectivisation
	- Wanted someone else to take the role of Secretary-General
- Voted for Kirov
	- Stalin's discipline
	- Charming

## 2. Intellectuals

- They too smart
- They see what Stalin do
- Big brain

## 3. Red Army

- Led by Trotsky
	- Trotsky bad
- Red army bad
- no can do
- Kill them all

# Economic impact

- Stalin wanted to modernise the Soviet Union to achieve the same economic and military levels as the Western powers
- This was to be done through the 5 year plans
	- They each set targets for industrial and agricultural development
	- Rapiud industrialisation and collectivisation was to work together

## Collectivisation

- merge or "collectivise" smaller individual farms into larger collective farms or kolkhozy
- based on the belief that larger units of land could be farmed more efficiently through mechanisation, the use of machines
	- e.g. using tractors
- considered a reversal of Lenin's NEP (New Economic Policy)
- by 1935 almost all the farms were collectivised

### Effects

- actually hampered the development of the agricultural sector
- only in the 1950s did the agricultural production only regained the original efficiency of 1928

### NEP (1921 - 1928) vs Collectivisation (1928 onwards)

#### Aims

##### NEP

- Improve the Soviet economy
- which was devastated following the Russian Revolution and the civil war

##### Collectivisation

- was more in line with Communist ideology of the party
- Aid in Stalin's main aim of rapid industrialisation
	- promises a secure food supply for the factory workers
	- creates excess crops that can be exported to other countries to raise funds for industrialisation
	- makes farming more efficient, allowing more farmers to work as factory workers instead

#### Measures

##### NEP

- farmers allowed to posses their own land
- could plant crops on it for personal use and sell extra crops for profit

##### Collectivisation

- Land owned by the state
- Distribute crops grown, equally
- Workers had quotas of crops to produce within their set working hours
	- paid with wages
	- provided equipment like tractors
	- all set by the state
- farmers who produced low quantities or were absent were punished

## Rapid industrialisation

# Political impact

## Great Terror

## Propaganda

# Social impact
