# Collectivisation â†’ Industrialisation

80% of Russia's populace were peasants. Stalin wanted to gather and combine (collectivise) the farms

- If they complied
    - Surrendered land and food
        - Land was given to the state for industrialisation
        - Food was sold **overseas**
    - You starve lol
        - Cannibalism just cause
    - 11 million deaths
- If they did not comply
    - Farmers chose to eat what they could, burn what they couldn't
        - Executed
        - Sent to purges
            - Labelled as Kulaks
    - 3 - 4 million deaths

# The Great Purge (Kirov's affair)

## Sergei Kirov

- party voted for this guy to replace Stalin as secretary-general
	- this was after the great famine in 1933-1934
	- party members saw this as a massive failure
- Kirov was purged

## Party members

- They voted against him
	- They saw what he did with Russia during the collectivisation
	- Wanted someone else to take the role of Secretary-General
- Voted for Kirov

## Political opponents

- prominent ones where given a show trial
- duh

## Intellectuals

- They too smart
- They could see through Stalin

## Artists, Musicians

- had a wide reach due to the nature of their job
- would be able to influence the masses against him

## Red Army

- Led by Trotsky
	- Trotsky bad
- Red army bad
	- no can do

# Economic impact

- Stalin wanted to modernise the Soviet Union to achieve the same economic and military levels as the Western powers
- This was to be done through the 5 year plans
	- They each set targets for industrial and agricultural development
	- Rapid industrialisation and collectivisation was to work together

## Collectivisation

- merge or "collectivise" smaller individual farms into larger collective farms or kolkhozy
	- 50-100 farms
- based on the belief that larger units of land could be farmed more efficiently through mechanisation, the use of machines
	- e.g. using tractors, combine harvesters
- idea was that this could speed up the process
	- less farmers needed for farming
	- excess manpower could be sent to industrialisation
- considered a reversal of Lenin's NEP (New Economic Policy)
- by 1935 almost all the farms were collectivised

### What actually happened

#### Resistance

- farmers were against the policy
	- they didn't want their land, farms and livestock to be confiscated
	- they had these for their whole lives, livelihoods; it was unfair to them
- some farmers chose not the comply
	- eat what they could
	- burn what they couldn't
- Stalin heard of what happened
	- ordered farmers who resisted to be sent to Gulags or killed on the spot
	- labelled as Kulaks

#### Lack of food supply

- farmers that surrendered
	- gave away their land and food
	- Land was given to the state for industrialisation
	- Food was sold **overseas**
- there was so little food left for the farmers

- actually hampered the development of the agricultural sector
- only in the 1950s did the agricultural production only regained the original efficiency of 1928

### Effectiveness

While the production numbers were higher with collectivisation, it was not a success due to the famine, as well as the slight increase in production numbers compared to the Tsarist times.

### NEP (1921 - 1928) vs Collectivisation (1928 onwards)

#### Aims

##### NEP

- Improve the Soviet economy
- which was devastated following the Russian Revolution and the civil war

##### Collectivisation

- was more in line with Communist ideology of the party
- Aid in Stalin's main aim of rapid industrialisation
	- promises a secure food supply for the factory workers
	- creates excess crops that can be exported to other countries to raise funds for industrialisation
	- makes farming more efficient, allowing more farmers to work as factory workers instead

#### Measures

##### NEP

- farmers allowed to posses their own land
- could plant crops on it for personal use and sell extra crops for profit

##### Collectivisation

- Land owned by the state
- Distribute crops grown, equally
- Workers had quotas of crops to produce within their set working hours
	- paid with wages
	- provided equipment like tractors
	- all set by the state
- farmers who produced low quantities or were absent were punished

## Rapid industrialisation

### 5 year plans

- first 5 year plans
	- focused on raw materials, oil, steel, electricity (1928-1932)
- second 5 year plans
	- focused on resources + infrastructure (1932-1937)
- third 5 year plans
	- consumer goods (1938-1940)

### Impacts

- good for the economy of the USSR
- people suffered though
	- shit living conditions
	- quotas were constantly being increase
