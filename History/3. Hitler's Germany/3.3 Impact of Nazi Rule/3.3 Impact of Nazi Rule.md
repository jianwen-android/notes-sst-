## Minorities (especially Jews)

### 1935 Nuremberg Laws

- hurt their business cause less than 1% of the German population was made of Jews

### Night of Broken glass

- Nazis saw this as an attack against all the Nazis
	- claimed that the attack was part of a wider Jewish conspiracy against Germany
	- they encouraged people of Germany to attack Jewish communities in Germany

## Women in Nazi Germany

### Employment

Measures were introduced which strongly discouraged women from working, including:

- the introduction of the Law for the Reduction of Unemployment, which gave women financial incentives to stay at home
- not conscripting women to help in the war effort until 1943

However, female labour was cheap and between 1933 and 1939 the number of women in employment actually rose by 2.4 million. As the German economy grew, women were needed in the workplace.

- white collar workers lost jobs

### Marriage and family

Hitler wanted a high birth rate so that the Aryan population would grow. He tried to achieve this by:

- introducing the Law for the Encouragement of Marriage which gave newlywed couples a loan of 1,000 marks, and allowed them to keep 250 marks for each child they had
	- by having 4 children, they essentially have "repaid" back the loan
- giving an award called the Motherâ€™s Cross to women who had large numbers of children
- allowing women to volunteer to have a baby for an Aryan member of the SS

### Kinder (Children)

### KÃ¼che (Kitchen)

- be good wife

## Propaganda

- Minister of Enlightenment & Propaganda - Joseph Goebbels controlled the following:
    - Magazines, books, music, film, art, radio broadcasts
- Controlling access to information meant people could only listen to Nazi ideas & aims, thus accepting them readily.

### Key ideas that Goebbels propagated

- Sense of belonging
- Power & strength
- Order
- Superiority of the Aryans
- Success
- Vision for the future
- German expansion
- Inferiority of Jews
