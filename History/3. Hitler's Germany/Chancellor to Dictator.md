Ez steps Hitler used to create absolute power in 1, 2, 3!

1. Destroy democracy
2. Getting rid of all oppositions
3. Combining positions

# Destroying democracy

## New elections

- Called for new elections for the Reichstag, Mar '33
- Although the Nazi Party was the single largest party in the Reichstag, Hitler wanted an overall majority

## Influencing the campaign

- Stopped newspaper from criticising the Nazis
- Dismissed officials who opposed Hitler
- Use uniformed followers to break up meetings of other parties and beat up opponents (SA & SS)
- Extreme Nazi violence throughout the campaign, especially against the Communist

## The Reichstag fire

- A week before the elections, the Reichstag building in Berlin went up in flames
- Hitler blamed the fire on the communists
- Used this as an excuse to issue an *emergency law*
- This law removed freedoms promised by the Weimar Republic
    - Right to a fair trial
    - Free press
- The fire was almost certainly started by the Nazis but the Germans did not know this then

<aside>
‚òùüèø Hindenburg was not actually a big fan of Democracy and the Communist and was happy to oblige when Hitler came to him

</aside>

- Used emergency powers (Article 48; Reichstag Fire Decree) to arrest Communist, break up meetings and frighten voters

## Results of election

- Nazis obtained 44%
- With the help of the Nationalist party, managed to scrap through an overall majority of 51%

## The Enabling act

- Hitler now schemed to have the Reichstag give up its powers and rule as a dictator
- To do this, the Reichstag had to pass an **"Enabling Act"** which required 2/3 majority
- Hitler achieved this in March '33.

### 4 ways to get the enabling act approved

1. Used SA & SS to intimidate the Reichstag
2. Banned communist deputies from coming to the Reichstag so they could not vote
3. Persuaded the Centre Party to vote for the Act by giving vague promises, e.g. not interfere in Catholic Church/schools
4. Using the votes of his allies, the Nationalist Party took over Germany as the only political party

### This is so sad (death of democracy)

1. Hitler could pass any laws for the next 4 years
2. Other political parties were banned by July '33
3. Trade Unions taken over by the Nazis
4. Press, radio and cinema placed under total Nazi control
5. Opponents arrested, imprisoned or killed
6. Concentration camps and forced labour camps
7. SS and Gestapo struck terror into many Nazi opponents
8. Many fled the country e.g. Albert Einstein and writer Thomas Mann

# Getting rid of all opposition

## The Night of the Long Knives (1934)

- Germany army officers were unimpressed with Hitler & SA
- Ernst Rohm, leader of the SA, was disappointed
    - Not given a more important role in the new government
    - Wanted to turn SA into a 2nd German army
    - Had control of 4 million men
    - Started to create trouble for Hitler
- Hitler wanted to have complete power within his own party
	- Decided to get rid of him and many of his followers
- Hitler called the leaders of the SA to a special conference
	- During the night, he had them dragged out of bed by SS and shot
	- Accused Rohm of plotting against him
- On the same night, many other political opponents all over Germany suffered the same fate
- Gained acceptance with the military
- No public protests - demonstrated Hitler's power and the people's fear
- 30th June: This became known as the Night of the Long Knives

<aside>
üíó  Ernst was hella gay lol

</aside>

# Combining roles of authority

- 2 months later, President Hindenberg died (democracy died with him üò≠ )
- Hitler combined the jobs of Chancellor and President
- He also became commander in chief of the armed forces
- He was now the supreme *dictator* of Germany: ***Fuhrer***
