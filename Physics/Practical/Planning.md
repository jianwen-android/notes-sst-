# IDP and DP

- State explicit your independent variables (x - axis) and dependant variables (y - axis)
- State 2 **measurable** values that should stay constant throughout the practical
	- These values must also be significant to the experiment
- check if you can express your relationship (if given) into a linear equation (for later)

# Procedures

- Spend 15 - 20 mins at most on practical planning :)

## Setup

- State the setup with a diagram
	- You can refer to any diagrams in the paper by quoting the figure number
- Or setup the experiment using step-by-step instructions

## Testing

- State **1** value for the independent variable for the procedure to test with first
- State how **1** dependant variable will be measured ( show that by varying the independent variable, you will obtain different dependant variable values)
- "Repeat steps a to b for further values of y" to obtain more values for the experiment

## Conclusion

- How do you obtain the unknown value? (usually using gradient or y intercept)
	- Mathematical manipulation of the gradient will usually require you to perform some operation on the independent or dependant variable
- Create a graph with the number of rows based on how many variables **measured and calculated**
	- Column headers should be e.g.
| Time/s | Length/cm | Time^2/s^2 |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- |
| 1      | 2         | 1^2           |
- "If the suggested relationship is correct, a ___ graph will be obtained as shown"
	- Craft a suitable graph using the appropriate **x** and **y** (from your manipulation) axis variables, and the suggested relationship between them
	- Usually a linear graph
	- y against x
- "The value of ___ can be determined from the ___ of the graph"
	- Usually from the gradient cause there's not much else you can get from a linear relationship

## Risk and precautions

- Should there be any form of risk, take note of them in the procedures
- Provide solutions to minimize or mitigate these risks

# Relationship between variables

- Typically linear

## Gradient (Linear)

- Typically a constant that needs to be found
	- Questions can be asking you to find the gradient
	- Or find a constant that can be found through the gradient
