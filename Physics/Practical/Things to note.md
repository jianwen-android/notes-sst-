# Errors

## Answering technique

### Error

- think of a possible cause for error
- or something that annoyed you/made it harder for you to perform the experiment

### Affect

- how does the error affect the measurements taken

### Solution

- what are some solutions to solve the root cause of the error
- or circumvent the error caused

### Effect

- how does the solution help improve the experiment/solve the problem

## Common examples

### Parallax error

- describe the parallax error (e.g. ruler is not placed against the object to be measured, resulting in a error when â€¦.)
- must be due to the setup of the experiment
	- not because of you

### Human reaction time error

- reaction time in starting or stopping the stopwatch
	- repeat the experiment several times and take the average time to reduce errors

### General/Systematic errors

- apparatus used is not precise enough
	- e.g. using meter rule to measure diameter of a pendulum bob
	- use a more precise one (e.g. Vernier calliper)

### Optics and light

#### Lens

- The middle of lens holder may not coincide with the centre of the lens.
	- This affects the accurate measurement of l.
	- The sharpness of image may not be consistent throughout the experiment as it is estimated by eye. This affects the accurate measurement of l.

#### Pins

- The holes made by the optical pins are large
- The pin nearer to the eye may appear larger and obstruct the pins and images behind through a wider angle
	- This affects the drawing of the reflected ray accurately and affects the accuracy of the angle of reflection
	- Use pins of smaller diameter as it will make smaller holes

### Oscillations or moving parts

- affected by wind
- unable to identify the maximum and the minimum points of the pendulum when oscillating

### Electronics

- error in resistance wire
	- there may be kinks on the resistance wire which cause the length of resistance to be longer than 100.0cm. This will increase the voltmeter reading which is inaccurate
- cross-sectional area of the wire may not be uniform
	- diameter

# Miscellaneous

## Measuring

- read off digital display if provided

- (else), always find the width of the smallest division (lets call it *w*)
	- if w<= 1mm, read to the smallest division
	- if w> 1mm, read to half the smallest division

## Calculations

- Measurements should always be in DP relative to the instrument
- SF Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest SF when multiplying/dividing
- DP Rule:
	- Answer should be in the lowest DP when adding/subtracting
