# Explanations

## Relationship

- Must state the **actual relationship** (linearly related)
- variable is ___ to ___

# Graph

## SLAP

### Scale

- Choose a scale with a factor of 1, 2 or 5
- Can choose to draw horizontally
- Indent scale by 1 big square if you have/want to

### Line

- Draw a best fit line with equal number of points, above and below the line
- Draw **all the way** from either y or x axis

### Axis

- follow the table headers / appropriate units
- arrows for the axis
- origin starting point (doesn't have to start from 0)
- actual header / physical unit
- plotted points must take up half of the paper

### Plotted points

- taking points from the line
	- measure to half the smallest division of the scale
	- write down the coordinates of the point beside
	- draw dotted lines (triangle for finding gradient)
- circle any outliers and call them out with "outlier"
- must be spread out across more than

## HUDA

### Headings

- alphabet assigned / physical unit

### Units

- units only in headings

### Decimal points

- read off the instrument if it is electronic
- if the width of the smallest division is less than 1mm
	- read off smallest division
- if bigger than 1mm,
	- read to half of the smallest division

### Accuracy

- how accurate your data is to the teachers
- no way to test for that
