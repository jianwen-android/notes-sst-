# General notes

a) wave motion is the propogation (moving) of disturbances

- wave motion can be observd in rope or water waves
- wave moves from left to right, but specific particles that carry the wave move up and down in their respective rest positiions
- kinetic energy is transferred from source to medium to end

b) waves are travelling disturbances that transfer energy but not the medium

c) definition

- speed: how fast a wave is travelling
- frequency: number of completed waves produced per unit time
- wavelength: shortest distance between any 2 points (or wave particles) that are in phase
- period: the time taken to produce 1 complete wave
- amplitude: maximum displacement of a point (or wave particle) from its rest position
- in phase: points have the same displacement  from rest positions, direction of travel and speed, seperated by interger number of cycles

d) wavefront is a imaginary line that joins all the points on a wave that are in phase

e) velocity / frequency = wavelength

f)

longitudinal: its long when it extends back and forth

- sound
- slinky

transverse: idk its just the opposite so its up and down

- electromagnetic waves
- AC electricity
- love waves

# Things to note

1. Specify what kind of energy is being transferred in a wave
	- rope or water waves: kinetic energy
	- etc.
2. waves undergo refraction and reflection similar to light
	- angle of incidence = angle of relflection
	- when a water wave crosses from deep to shallow region, wave speed decreases, causing it to refract towards the normal
		- frequency usually remains unchanged as it is produced at its source)
		- wavefronts are connected to one another even at the boundary of the deep and shallow water

3. explaining how waves are made
	- explain how the source creates disturbances in the medium
	- then state where the waves moves towards
