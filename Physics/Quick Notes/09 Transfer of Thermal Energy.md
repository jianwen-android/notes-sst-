# Conduction

- Particles gain kinetic energy from heating element and vibrate vigorously.
- The particles collide with neighbouring particles, causing them to vibrate vigorously as well. 

## Free electron diffusion

- Free electrons in the metal gain kinetic energy from the heating element and collide with other atoms in cooler parts of the metal, passing on their kinetic energy in the process

# Convection

- as cool air gains heat, it expands and becomes less dense than the surrounding air, thus rising up. 
- Since the upper region is cooler, it is denser and therefore sinks. 
- The difference in the densities of the air in different regions sets up a convection current

# Radiation

- all bodies emit infrared radiation

## Rate of radiation

- darker the colour of the surface, the higher the rate of absorption or emission of infrared radiation
- the duller the texture of the surface, the higher the rate of absorption or emission of infrared radiation

### Other stuff like

- surface area
- higher temperature of an object **relative to its surroundings** results in faster emission of infrared radiation
