# Right hand rule

- shows you the direction of magnetic field lines produced (4 fingers) by current flowing through a conductor (thumb)
- shows you the poles of a solenoid (thumb points to North), given the direction of current (4 fingers)

# Fleming's Left hand rule (LHR)

- shows you the direction of force on a current carrying conductor (thumb), given the direction of magnetic field (index finger from North to South) and direction of conventional current (middle finger)

# Fleming's Right hand rule

- shows you the direction of induced current on a moving conductor (middle finger), given the direction of magnetic field (index finger from North to South) and the direction of movement (thumb)
